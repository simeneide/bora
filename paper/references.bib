We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about {JSTOR}, please contact support@jstor.org. {SUMMARY} We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The 'lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence has seen a number of breakthroughs in recent years, with games often serving as significant milestones. A common feature of games with these successes is that they involve information symmetry among the players, where all players have identical information. This property of perfect information, though, is far more common in games than in real-world problems. Poker is the quintessential game of imperfect information, and it has been a longstanding challenge problem in artificial intelligence. In this paper we introduce {DeepStack}, a new algorithm for imperfect information settings such as poker. It combines recursive reasoning to handle information asymmetry, decomposition to focus computation on the relevant decision, and a form of intuition about arbitrary poker situations that is automatically learned from self-play games using deep learning. In a study involving dozens of participants and 44,000 hands of poker, {DeepStack} becomes the first computer program to beat professional poker players in heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em. Furthermore, we show this approach dramatically reduces worst-case exploitability compared to the abstraction paradigm that has been favored for over a decade.},

	doi = {10.1136/bmj.319.7209.0a},
	abstract = {This book is aimed to provide an overview of general deep learning methodology and its applications to a variety of signal and information processing tasks. The application areas are chosen with the following three criteria: 1) expertise or knowledge of the authors; 2) the application areas that have already been transformed by the successful use of deep learning technology, such as speech recognition and computer vision; and 3) the application areas that have the potential to be impacted significantly by deep learning and that have gained concentrated research efforts, including natural language and text processing, information retrieval, and multimodal information processing empowered by multi-task deep learning. In Chapter 1, we provide the background of deep learning, as intrinsically connected to the use of multiple layers of nonlinear transformations to derive features from the sensory signals such as speech and visual images. In the most recent literature, deep learning is embodied also as representation learning, which involves a hierarchy of features or concepts where higher-level representations of them are defined from lower-level ones and where the same lower-level representations help to define higher-level ones. In Chapter 2, a brief historical account of deep learning is presented. In particular, selected chronological development of speech recognition is used to illustrate the recent impact of deep learning that has become a dominant technology in speech recognition industry within only a few years since the start of a collaboration between academic and industrial researchers in applying deep learning to speech recognition. In Chapter 3, a three-way classification scheme for a large body of work in deep learning is developed. We classify a growing number of deep learning techniques into unsupervised, supervised, and hybrid categories, and present qualitative descriptions and a literature survey for each category. From Chapter 4 to Chapter 6, we discuss in detail three popular deep networks and related learning methods, one in each category. Chapter 4 is devoted to deep autoencoders as a prominent example of the unsupervised deep learning techniques. Chapter 5 gives a major example in the hybrid deep network category, which is the discriminative feed-forward neural network for supervised learning with many layers initialized using layer-by-layer generative, unsupervised pre-training. In Chapter 6, deep stacking networks and several of the variants are discussed in detail, which exemplify the discriminative or supervised deep learning techniques in the three-way categorization scheme. In Chapters 7-11, we select a set of typical and successful applications of deep learning in diverse areas of signal and information processing and of applied artificial intelligence. In Chapter 7, we review the applications of deep learning to speech and audio processing, with emphasis on speech recognition organized according to several prominent themes. In Chapters 8, we present recent results of applying deep learning to language modeling and natural language processing. Chapter 9 is devoted to selected applications of deep learning to information retrieval including Web search. In Chapter 10, we cover selected applications of deep learning to image object recognition in computer vision. Selected applications of deep learning to multi-modal processing and multi-task learning are reviewed in Chapter 11. Finally, an epilogue is given in Chapter 12 to summarize what we presented in earlier chapters and to discuss future challenges and directions.},

The second is a learning algorithm, based on {AdaBoost}, which selects a small number of critical visual features and yields extremely efficient classifiers [6]. The third contribution is a method for combining classifiers in a “cascade” which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. A set of experiments in the domain of face detection are presented. The system yields face detection performace comparable to the best previous systems [18, 13, 16, 12, 1]. Implemented on a conventional desktop, face detection proceeds at 15 frames per second.},

	abstract = {Despite its simplicity, the naive Bayes learning scheme performs well on most classification tasks, and is often significantly more accurate than more sophisticated methods. Although the probability estimates that it produces can be inaccurate, it often assigns maximum probability to the correct class. This suggests that its good performance might be restricted to situations where the output is categorical. It is therefore interesting to see how it performs in domains where the predicted value is numeric, because in this case, predictions are more sensitive to inaccurate probability estimates.{\textbackslash}r{\textbackslash}{nThis} paper shows how to apply the naive Bayes methodology to numeric prediction (i.e., regression) tasks by modeling the probability distribution of the target value with kernel density estimators, and compares it to linear regression, locally weighted linear regression, and a method that produces “model trees”—decision trees with linear regression functions at the leaves. Although we exhibit an artificial dataset for which naive Bayes is the method of choice, on real-world datasets it is almost uniformly worse than locally weighted linear regression and model trees. The comparison with linear regression depends on the error measure: for one measure naive Bayes performs similarly, while for another it is worse. We also show that standard naive Bayes applied to regression problems by discretizing the target value performs similarly badly. We then present empirical evidence that isolates naive Bayes' independence assumption as the culprit for its poor performance in the regression setting. These results indicate that the simplistic statistical assumption that naive Bayes makes is indeed more restrictive for regression than for classification.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce Factorization Machines ({FM}) which are a new model class that combines the advantages of Support Vector Machines ({SVM}) with factorization models. Like {SVMs}, {FMs} are a general predictor working with any real valued feature vector. In contrast to {SVMs}, {FMs} model all interactions between variables using factorized parameters. Thus they are able to estimate interactions even in problems with huge sparsity (like recommender systems) where {SVMs} fail. We show that the model equation of {FMs} can be calculated in linear time and thus {FMs} can be optimized directly. So unlike nonlinear {SVMs}, a transformation in the dual form is not necessary and the model parameters can be estimated directly without the need of any support vector in the solution. We show the relationship to {SVMs} and the advantages of {FMs} for parameter estimation in sparse settings. On the other hand there are many different factorization models like matrix factorization, parallel factor analysis or specialized models like {SVD}++, {PITF} or {FPMC}. The drawback of these models is that they are not applicable for general prediction tasks but work only with special input data. Furthermore their model equations and optimization algorithms are derived individually for each task. We show that {FMs} can mimic these models just by specifying the input data (i.e. the feature vectors). This makes {FMs} easily applicable even for users without expert knowledge in factorization models.},

	abstract = {Generalized linear models with nonlinear feature transformations are widely used for large-scale regression and classification problems with sparse inputs. Memorization of feature interactions through a wide set of cross-product feature transformations are effective and interpretable, while generalization requires more feature engineering effort. With less feature engineering, deep neural networks can generalize better to unseen feature combinations through low-dimensional dense embeddings learned for the sparse features. However, deep neural networks with embeddings can over-generalize and recommend less relevant items when the user-item interactions are sparse and high-rank. In this paper, we present Wide \& Deep learning---jointly trained wide linear models and deep neural networks---to combine the benefits of memorization and generalization for recommender systems. We productionized and evaluated the system on Google Play, a commercial mobile app store with over one billion active users and over one million apps. Online experiment results show that Wide \& Deep significantly increased app acquisitions compared with wide-only and deep-only models. We have also open-sourced our implementation in {TensorFlow}.},

	abstract = {Customer preferences for products are drifting over time. Product perception and popularity are constantly changing as new selection emerges. Similarly, customer inclinations are evolving, leading them to ever redefine their taste. Thus, modeling temporal dynamics should be a key when designing recommender systems or general customer preference models. However, this raises unique challenges. Within the eco-system intersecting multiple products and customers, many different characteristics are shifting simultaneously, while many of them influence each other and often those shifts are delicate and associated with a few data instances. This distinguishes the problem from concept drift explorations, where mostly a single concept is tracked. Classical time-window or instance-decay approaches cannot work, as they lose too much signal when discarding data instances. A more sensitive approach is required, which can make better distinctions between transient effects and long term patterns. The paradigm we offer is creating a model tracking the time changing behavior throughout the life span of the data. This allows us to exploit the relevant components of all data instances, while discarding only what is modeled as being irrelevant. Accordingly, we revamp two leading collaborative filtering recommendation approaches. Evaluation is made on a large movie rating dataset by Netflix. Results are encouraging and better than those previously reported on this dataset.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learn- ing residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, in- stead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide com- prehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the {ImageNet} dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers—8× deeper than {VGG} nets [41] but still having lower complex- ity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the {ImageNet} test set. This result won the 1st place on the {ILSVRC} 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on {CIFAR}-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our ex- tremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative im- provement on the {COCO} object detection dataset.

We examine how we can incorporate the tags and other metadata into a nearest-neighbor collaborative filtering ({CF}) algo- rithm, by replacing the traditional usage-based similarity metrics by tag overlap, and by fusing tag-based similarity with usage-based similarity. In addition, we perform experiments with content-based filtering by using the metadata content to recommend interesting items. We generate recommendations directly based on Kullback- Leibler divergence of the metadata language models, and we ex- plore the use of this metadata in calculating user and item simi- larities. We perform our experiments on three data sets from two different domains: Delicious, {CiteULike} and {BibSonomy}.},

Traditional sentence-level sentiment classification research focuses on one-technique-fits-all solution or only centers on one special type of sentences. In this paper, we propose a divide-and-conquer approach which first classifies sentences into different types, then performs sentiment analysis separately on sentences from each type. Specifically, we find that sentences tend to be more complex if they contain more sentiment targets. Thus, we propose to first apply a neural network based sequence model to classify opinionated sentences into three types according to the number of targets appeared in a sentence. Each group of sentences is then fed into a one-dimensional convolutional neural network separately for sentiment classification. Our approach has been evaluated on four sentiment classification datasets and compared with a wide range of baselines. Experimental results show that: (1) sentence type classification can improve the performance of sentence-level sentiment analysis; (2) the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmarking datasets.},

In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network ({RPN}) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An {RPN} is a fully-convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. {RPNs} are trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-{CNN} for detection. With a simple alternating optimization, {RPN} and Fast R-{CNN} can be trained to share convolu-tional features. For the very deep {VGG}-16 model [18], our detection system has a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a {GPU}, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on {PASCAL} {VOC} 2007 (73.2\% {mAP}) and 2012 (70.4\% {mAP}) using 300 proposals per image.

These data are large user/item matrices where each user has provided feedback on only a small subset of items, ei- ther explicitly (e.g., through star ratings) or implicitly (e.g., through views or purchases). In contrast to traditional matrix factorization approaches, Poisson factorization implicitly models each user's limited attention to consume items. Moreover, because of the mathematical form of the Poisson likelihood, the model needs only to explicitly consider the observed entries in the matrix, leading to both scalable computation and good predictive performance. We develop a variational inference algorithm for approximate posterior inference that scales up to massive data sets. This is an efficient algorithm that iterates over the observed entries and adjusts an approximate posterior over the user/item representations. We apply our method to large real-world user data containing users rating movies, users listening to songs, and users reading scientific papers. In all these settings, Bayesian Poisson factorization outperforms state-of-the-art matrix factorization methods.},

We also explore some of the challenges that arise in a real-world system that may appear at first to be outside the domain of traditional machine learning research. These include useful tricks for memory savings, methods for assessing and visualizing performance, practical methods for providing confidence estimates for predicted probabilities, calibration methods, and methods for automated management of features. Finally, we also detail several directions that did not turn out to be beneficial for us, despite promising results elsewhere in the literature.

These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program {AlphaGo} achieved a 99.8\% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.},

	abstract = {Machine learning ({ML}) models may be deemed confidential due to their sensitive training data, commercial value, or use in security applications. Increasingly often, confidential {ML} models are being deployed with publicly accessible query interfaces. {ML}-as-a-service ("predictive analytics") systems are an example: Some allow users to train models on potentially sensitive data and charge others for access on a pay-per-query basis.   The tension between model confidentiality and public access motivates our investigation of model extraction attacks. In such attacks, an adversary with black-box access, but no prior knowledge of an {ML} model's parameters or training data, aims to duplicate the functionality of (i.e., "steal") the model. Unlike in classical learning theory settings, {ML}-as-a-service offerings may accept partial feature vectors as inputs and include confidence values with predictions. Given these practices, we show simple, efficient attacks that extract target {ML} models with near-perfect fidelity for popular model classes including logistic regression, neural networks, and decision trees. We demonstrate these attacks against the online services of {BigML} and Amazon Machine Learning. We further show that the natural countermeasure of omitting confidence values from model outputs still admits potentially harmful model extraction attacks. Our results highlight the need for careful {ML} model deployment and new model extraction countermeasures.},

An advantage of the proposed architecture is that it can be used to effectively recommend items using either content that describes the items or user-item ratings.

We demonstrate how these models are naturally converted into a unified feed-forward network structure, which coincides with popular {DL} components. {SARM} is constructed by stacking multiple unfolded and truncated regression models. Compared to the {PCANet}, whose feature extraction layers are completely linear, {SARM} naturally introduces non-linearities, by embedding sparsity regularization. The parameters of {SARM} are easily obtained, by solving a series of light-weight problems, e.g., {PCA} or {KSVD}. Extensive experiments are conducted, which show that {SARM} outperforms the existing simple deep baseline, {PCANet}, and is on par with many state-of-the-art deep models, but with much lower computational loads.},

We present a completely automatic system to address this {IM}2CAD problem that produces high quality results on challenging imagery from interior home design and remodeling websites. Our approach iteratively optimizes the placement and scale of objects in the room to best match scene renderings to the input photo, using image comparison metrics trained via deep convolutional neural nets.

	abstract = {Autonomous indoor navigation of Micro Aerial Vehicles ({MAVs}) possesses many challenges. One main reason is that {GPS} has limited precision in indoor environments. The additional fact that {MAVs} are not able to carry heavy weight or power consuming sensors, such as range finders, makes indoor autonomous navigation a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a practical system in which a quadcopter autonomously navigates indoors and finds a specific target, i.e., a book bag, by using a single camera. A deep learning model, Convolutional Neural Network ({ConvNet}), is used to learn a controller strategy that mimics an expert pilot's choice of action. We show our system's performance through real-time experiments in diverse indoor locations. To understand more about our trained network, we use several visualization techniques.},

To learn hand-eye coordination for grasping, we trained a large convolutional neural network to predict the probability that task-space motion of the gripper will result in successful grasps, using only monocular camera images and independently of camera calibration or the current robot pose. This requires the network to observe the spatial relationship between the gripper and objects in the scene, thus learning hand-eye coordination. We then use this network to servo the gripper in real time to achieve successful grasps. To train our network, we collected over 800,000 grasp attempts over the course of two months, using between 6 and 14 robotic manipulators at any given time, with differences in camera placement and hardware. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method achieves effective real-time control, can successfully grasp novel objects, and corrects mistakes by continuous servoing.},

We develop machine learning systems with this important capacity by developing new deep generative models, models that combine the representational power of deep learning with the inferential power of Bayesian reasoning. We develop a class of sequential generative models that are built on the principles of feedback and attention. These two characteristics lead to generative models that are among the state-of-the art in density estimation and image generation. We demonstrate the one-shot generalization ability of our models using three tasks: unconditional sampling, generating new exemplars of a given concept, and generating new exemplars of a family of concepts. In all cases our models are able to generate compelling and diverse samples—having seen new examples just once—providing an important class of general-purpose models for one-shot machine learning.},

In this work, we investigate an adaptive clustering technique for content recommenda-tion based on exploration-exploitation strategies in contex-tual multi-armed bandit settings. Our algorithm takes into account the collaborative effects that arise due to the inter-action of the users with the items, by dynamically grouping users based on the items under consideration and, at the same time, grouping items based on the similarity of the clusterings induced over the users. The resulting algorithm thus takes advantage of preference patterns in the data in a way akin to collaborative filtering methods. We provide an empirical analysis on medium-size real-world datasets, showing scalability and increased prediction performance (as measured by click-through rate) over state-of-the-art meth-ods for clustering bandits. We also provide a regret analysis within a standard linear stochastic noise setting.},

	abstract = {Synthesizing photo-realistic images from text descriptions is a challenging problem in computer vision and has many practical applications. Samples generated by existing text-to-image approaches can roughly reflect the meaning of the given descriptions, but they fail to contain necessary details and vivid object parts. In this paper, we propose stacked Generative Adversarial Networks ({StackGAN}) to generate photo-realistic images conditioned on text descriptions. The Stage-I {GAN} sketches the primitive shape and basic colors of the object based on the given text description, yielding Stage-I low resolution images. The Stage-{II} {GAN} takes Stage-I results and text descriptions as inputs, and generates high resolution images with photo-realistic details. The Stage-{II} {GAN} is able to rectify defects and add compelling details with the refinement process. Samples generated by {StackGAN} are more plausible than those generated by existing approaches. Importantly, our {StackGAN} for the first time generates realistic 256 x 256 images conditioned on only text descriptions, while state-of-the-art methods can generate at most 128 x 128 images. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed {StackGAN}, extensive experiments are conducted on {CUB} and Oxford-102 datasets, which contain enough object appearance variations and are widely-used for text-to-image generation analysis.},

The new methods, which we call proximal policy optimization ({PPO}), have some of the benefits of trust region policy optimization ({TRPO}), but they are much simpler to implement, more general, and have better sample complexity (empirically). Our experiments test {PPO} on a collection of benchmark tasks, including simulated robotic locomotion and Atari game playing, and we show that {PPO} outperforms other online policy gradient methods, and overall strikes a favorable balance between sample complexity, simplicity, and wall-time.},

The improved model, {YOLOv}2, is state-of-the-art on standard detection tasks like {PASCAL} {VOC} and {COCO}. At 67 {FPS}, {YOLOv}2 gets 76.8 {mAP} on {VOC} 2007.

Finally we propose a method to jointly train on object detection and classification. Using this method we train {YOLO}9000 simultaneously on the {COCO} detection dataset and the {ImageNet} classification dataset. Our joint training allows {YOLO}9000 to predict detections for object classes that don't have labelled detection data. We validate our approach on the {ImageNet} detection task. {YOLO}9000 gets 19.7 {mAP} on the {ImageNet} detection validation set despite only having detection data for 44 of the 200 classes. On the 156 classes not in {COCO}, {YOLO}9000 gets 16.0 {mAP}. But {YOLO} can detect more than just 200 classes; it predicts detections for more than 9000 different object categories.

Recommender systems are the application of choice to open up the collection to these users. Collaborative filtering has the disadvantage that it relies on explicit ratings, which are often unavailable, and generally disregards the temporal nature of music consumption. On the other hand, item co-occurrence algorithms, such as the recently introduced word2vec-based recommenders, are typically left without an effective user representation. In this paper, we present a new approach to model users through recurrent neural networks by sequentially processing consumed items, represented by any type of embeddings and other context features. This way we obtain semantically rich user representations, which capture a user's musical taste over time. Our experimental analysis on large-scale user data shows that our model can be used to predict future songs a user will likely listen to, both in the short and long term.},

	title = {Learning Depth from Single Monocular Images Using Stereo Supervisory Input},
	abstract = {Stereo vision systems are often employed in robotics as a means for obstacle avoidance and navigation. These systems have inherent depth-sensing limitations, with significant problems in occluded and untextured regions, leading to sparse depth maps. We propose using a monocular depth estimation algorithm to tackle these problems, in a Self-Supervised Learning ({SSL}) framework. The algorithm learns online from the sparse depth map generated by a stereo vision system, producing a dense depth map. The algorithm is designed to be computationally efficient, for implementation onboard resource-constrained mobile robots and unmanned aerial vehicles. Within that context, it can be used to provide both reliability against a stereo camera failure, as well as more accurate depth perception, by filling in missing depth information, in occluded and low texture regions. This in turn allows the use of more efficient sparse stereo vision algorithms. We test the algorithm offline on a new, high resolution, stereo dataset, of scenes shot in indoor environments, and processed using both sparse and dense stereo matching algorithms. It is shown that the algorithm's performance doesn't deteriorate, and in fact sometimes improves, when learning only from sparse, high confidence regions rather than from the computationally expensive, dense, occlusion-filled and highly post-processed dense depth maps. This makes the approach very promising for self-supervised learning on autonomous robots.},

It is designed to work at very high throughput and process hundreds of millions of messages daily. The system exploits state-of-the-art, large-scale deep learning. We describe the architecture of the system as well as the challenges that we faced while building it, like response diversity and scalability. We also introduce a new method for semantic clustering of user-generated content that requires only a modest amount of explicitly labeled data.},

Yet, these methods require a significant amount of hyperparameters tuning in order to achieve the best results. In particular, tuning the learning rates in the stochastic optimization process is still one of the main bottlenecks. In this paper, we propose a new stochastic gradient descent procedure for deep networks that does not require any learning rate setting. Contrary to previous methods, we do not adapt the learning rates nor we make use of the assumed curvature of the objective function. Instead, we reduce the optimization process to a game of betting on a coin and propose a learning-rate-free optimal algorithm for this scenario. Theoretical convergence is proven for convex and quasi-convex functions and empirical evidence shows the advantage of our algorithm over popular stochastic gradient algorithms.},

To address this limitation, we propose {StarGAN}, a novel and scalable approach that can perform image-to-image translations for multiple domains using only a single model. Such a unified model architecture of {StarGAN} allows simultaneous training of multiple datasets with different domains within a single network. This leads to {StarGAN}'s superior quality of translated images compared to existing models as well as the novel capability of flexibly translating an input image to any desired target domain. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a facial attribute transfer and a facial expression synthesis tasks.},

	abstract = {Automatically generating coherent and semantically meaningful text has many applications in machine translation, dialogue systems, image captioning, etc. Recently, by combining with policy gradient, Generative Adversarial Nets ({GAN}) that use a discriminative model to guide the training of the generative model as a reinforcement learning policy has shown promising results in text generation. However, the scalar guiding signal is only available after the entire text has been generated and lacks intermediate information about text structure during the generative process. As such, it limits its success when the length of the generated text samples is long (more than 20 words). In this paper, we propose a new framework, called {LeakGAN}, to address the problem for long text generation. We allow the discriminative net to leak its own high-level extracted features to the generative net to further help the guidance. The generator incorporates such informative signals into all generation steps through an additional Manager module, which takes the extracted features of current generated words and outputs a latent vector to guide the Worker module for next-word generation. Our extensive experiments on synthetic data and various real-world tasks with Turing test demonstrate that {LeakGAN} is highly effective in long text generation and also improves the performance in short text generation scenarios. More importantly, without any supervision, {LeakGAN} would be able to implicitly learn sentence structures only through the interaction between Manager and Worker.},

However, these methods typically suffer from two major challenges: very high sample complexity and brittle convergence properties, which necessitate meticulous hyperparameter tuning. Both of these challenges severely limit the applicability of such methods to complex, real-world domains. In this paper, we propose soft actor-critic, an off-policy actor-critic deep {RL} algorithm based on the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework. In this framework, the actor aims to maximize expected reward while also maximizing entropy. That is, to succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible. Prior deep {RL} methods based on this framework have been formulated as Q-learning methods. By combining off-policy updates with a stable stochastic actor-critic formulation, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of continuous control benchmark tasks, outperforming prior on-policy and off-policy methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in contrast to other off-policy algorithms, our approach is very stable, achieving very similar performance across different random seeds.},

The Mallows rank model is among the most successful approaches to analyse rank data, but its computational complexity has limited its use to a particular form based on Kendall distance. We develop new computationally tractable methods for Bayesian inference in Mallows models that work with any right-invariant distance. Our method performs inference on the consensus ranking of the items, also when based on partial rankings, such as top-k items or pairwise comparisons. We prove that items that none of the assessors has ranked do not influence the maximum a posteriori consensus ranking, and can therefore be ignored. When assessors are many or heterogeneous, we propose a mixture model for clustering them in homogeneous subgroups, with cluster-specific consensus rankings. We develop approximate stochastic algorithms that allow a fully probabilistic analysis, leading to coherent quantifications of uncertainties. We make probabilistic predictions on the class membership of assessors based on their ranking of just some items, and predict missing individual preferences, as needed in recommendation systems. We test our approach using several experimental and benchmark datasets.},

For these methods, conventional features in a relatively high dimensional feature space may suffer from sparseness and thus exhibit less discriminative power on unseen data. This article presents a learning framework of feature transformation, addressing the sparseness problem by transforming sparse conventional base features into less sparse high-level features (i.e. meta features) with the help of a large amount of automatically annotated data. The meta features are derived by bucketing similar base features according to the frequency in large data, and used together with base features in our final system. We apply the framework to part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing. Experimental results show that our systems perform better than the baseline systems in both tasks on standard evaluation. For the dependency parsing task, our parsers achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the Chinese data and comparable accuracy with the best known systems on the English data. Further analysis indicates that our proposed approach is effective in processing unseen data and features.},

These neural networks were trained by supervised learning from human expert moves, and by reinforcement learning from self-play. Here, we introduce an algorithm based solely on reinforcement learning, without hu-man data, guidance, or domain knowledge beyond game rules. {AlphaGo} becomes its own teacher: a neural network is trained to predict {AlphaGo}'s own move selections and also the winner of {AlphaGo}'s games. This neural network improves the strength of tree search, re-sulting in higher quality move selection and stronger self-play in the next iteration. Starting tabula rasa, our new program {AlphaGo} Zero achieved superhuman performance, winning 100-0 against the previously published, champion-defeating {AlphaGo}. Much progress towards artificial intelligence has been made using supervised learning sys-tems that are trained to replicate the decisions of human experts 1–4 .

Through this process, it acquires a strong prior model for agents' be-haviour, as well as the ability to bootstrap to richer predictions about agents' characteristics and mental states using only a small number of behavioural observations. We apply the {ToM}-net to agents behaving in simple gridworld en-vironments, showing that it learns to model ran-dom, algorithmic, and deep reinforcement learn-ing agents from varied populations, and that it passes classic {ToM} tasks such as the " Sally-Anne " test (Wimmer \& Perner, 1983; Baron-Cohen et al., 1985) of recognising that others can hold false beliefs about the world.

Various approaches have been suggested for providing meaningful recommendations to users. One of the proposed approaches is to consider a recommender system as a Markov decision process ({MDP}) problem and try to solve it using reinforcement learning ({RL}). However, existing {RL}-based methods have an obvious drawback. To solve an {MDP} in a recommender system, they encountered a problem with the large number of discrete actions that bring {RL} to a larger class of problems. In this paper, we propose a novel {RL}-based recommender system. We formulate a recommender system as a gridworld game by using a biclustering technique that can reduce the state and action space significantly. Using biclustering not only reduces space but also improves the recommendation quality effectively handling the cold-start problem. In addition, our approach can provide users with some explanation why the system recommends certain items. Lastly, we examine the proposed algorithm on a real-world dataset and achieve a better performance than the widely used recommendation algorithm.},

Individuals j in a population are each assumed to have a personal ranking R j ∼ Mallows(ρ, α), although even the R j are probably not fully observed. Learning either ρ or individual rankings R j allows one to recommend highly ranked items to individuals from the population. Frigessi's research team have developed a Bayesian Mallows model for preference learning (e.g. [1]), and associated {MCMC} schemes to infer the parameters, when the data are partial observations of R j 's, such as pairwise preferences, partial rankings, or even simply clicks on sufficiently high-ranked items. However, to date, the focus of effort has been to infer parameters of the model conditional on fixed data, and little effort has been made to consider the online learning challenge, in which one must balance exploration and exploitation. We are interested in quickly improving our knowledge to lead to better recommendations. A simple framework is as follows. Suppose that we wish to recommend items to a sequence of individuals j = 1, 2, . . ., each of whom has a personal ranking R j ∼ Mallows(ρ, α). The recommender's action j is an item a j recommended to user j. The system receives reward equal to the actual ranking by individual j of action a j , and updates the beliefs about ρ. The objective is to try to minimise the cumulative ranking (small rank numbers are good). This is a simple objective, and the inference is easy, although the data assumptions are unrealistic; the next step might well be a slightly more complicated model in which the system receives 0/1 reward indicating whether the recommended item was " good enough " for the user. A greedy policy will always take the action currently believed to be best, but may well result in insufficient information gain. In this setting, the greedy action is the a which minimises E[R j,a {\textbar} History] = n r=1 rp(R j,a = r {\textbar} ρ, α)p(ρ {\textbar} History). A Thompson sampling [2] approach will not integrate out all this uncertainty. Instead it will draw a singl ρ from the belief distribution p(ρ {\textbar} History) then choose a to minimise E[R j,a ρ, α] = n r=1 rp(R j,a = r ρ, α). This additional randomness in Thompson sampling will ensure that if the belief distribution p(ρ {\textbar} History) is not particularly focused, exploratory actions are taken which will hopefully improve knowledge about ρ. Note however one of the critical gaps with Thompson sampling: it is far from clear whether the action selected will indeed be the most informative. We believe that if some of the distributions involved in the Mallows inference can be explicitly dealt with then further approaches such as {UCB} or knowledge gradient may well be easily implemented, and this is one direction we could follow if a more theoretical project appealed. You will test your developed approach using several experimental and benchmark datasets, building on examples already constructed by Frigessi's team. If you are successful, we will also test the methods in an on-line industrial framework in which scalability issues, when either the number of users or items become large, will need to be carefully considered. Skills required: You will be working with {MCMC}, so will need to be comfortable with computer programming. You will be doing Bayesian stats, and thinking about decision-making. A theoretical slant on the project would involve some advanced probability, whereas a practical slant would be more computational.},

In this paper, we introduce a {\textbackslash}emph\{replay\} methodology for contextual bandit algorithm evaluation. Different from simulator-based approaches, our method is completely data-driven and very easy to adapt to different applications. More importantly, our method can provide provably unbiased evaluations. Our empirical results on a large-scale news article recommendation dataset collected from Yahoo!

Furthermore, comparisons between our offline replay and online bucket evaluation of several contextual bandit algorithms show accuracy and effectiveness of our offline evaluation method.},

Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that underlie all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assumptions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances are illustrated using a general theory of causation based on the Structural Causal Model ({SCM}) described in Pearl (2000a), which subsumes and unifies other approaches to causation, and provides a coherent mathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types of causal queries: those about (1) the effects of potential interventions, (2) probabilities of counterfactuals, and (3) direct and indirect effects (also known as "mediation"). Finally, the paper defines the formal and conceptual relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks and presents tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong features of both. The tools are demonstrated in the analyses of mediation, causes of effects, and probabilities of causation.},

Here we describe a large-scale deep recommendation engine that we developed and deployed at Pinterest. We develop a data-efficient Graph Convolutional Network ({GCN}) algorithm {PinSage}, which combines efficient random walks and graph convolutions to generate embeddings of nodes (i.e., items) that incorporate both graph structure as well as node feature information. Compared to prior {GCN} approaches, we develop a novel method based on highly efficient random walks to structure the convolutions and design a novel training strategy that relies on harder-and-harder training examples to improve robustness and convergence of the model. We deploy {PinSage} at Pinterest and train it on 7.5 billion exam-ples on a graph with 3 billion nodes representing pins and boards, and 18 billion edges. According to offline metrics, user studies and A/B tests, {PinSage} generates higher-quality recommendations than comparable deep learning and graph-based alternatives. To our knowledge, this is the largest application of deep graph embed-dings to date and paves the way for a new generation of web-scale recommender systems based on graph convolutional architectures.},

	abstract = {In sequential decision problems in an unknown environment, the decision maker often faces a dilemma over whether to explore to discover more about the environment, or to exploit current knowledge. We address the exploration-exploitation dilemma in a general setting encompassing both standard and contextualised bandit problems. The contextual bandit problem has recently resurfaced in attempts to maximise click-through rates in web based applications, a task with significant commercial interest. In this article we consider an approach of Thompson (1933) which makes use of samples from the posterior distributions for the instantaneous value of each action. We extend the approach by introducing a new algorithm, Optimistic Bayesian Sampling ({OBS}), in which the probability of playing an action increases with the uncertainty in the estimate of the action value. This results in better directed exploratory behaviour. We prove that, under unrestrictive assumptions, both approaches result in optimal behaviour with respect to the average reward criterion of Yang and Zhu (2002). We implement {OBS} and measure its performance in simulated Bernoulli bandit and linear regression domains, and also when tested with the task of personalised news article recommendation on a Yahoo! Front Page Today Module data set. We find that {OBS} performs competitively when compared to recently proposed benchmark algorithms and outperforms Thompson's method throughout. © 2012 Benedict C.

This requires balancing exploration (learning about the objective) and exploitation (localizing the maximum), a problem well-studied in the multi-armed bandit literature. In many applications, however, we require that the sampled function values exceed some prespecified " safety " thresh-old, a requirement that existing algorithms fail to meet. Examples include medical applications where patient comfort must be guaranteed, recommender systems aiming to avoid user dissatisfaction, and robotic control, where one seeks to avoid controls causing physical harm to the platform. We tackle this novel, yet rich, set of problems under the assumption that the unknown function satisfies regularity conditions expressed via a Gaussian process prior. We develop an efficient algorithm called {SAFEOPT}, and theoretically guarantee its convergence to a natural notion of optimum reachable under safety constraints.

We present a range of simple and intuitive models based on uncertainty about user preferences that show how diversity emerges naturally as a result of seeking to maximise the probability that the user will click on an element. As such we give an argument as to why diversity is desirable which avoids the need for it as a separate objective.

We apply our method to a wide range of Atari games and compare {BDQN} to a powerful baseline: the double deep Q-network ({DDQN}). Since {BDQN} carries out more efficient exploration, it is able to reach higher rewards substantially faster: in less than 5M-+1M interactions for almost half of the games to reach {DDQN} scores. We also establish theoretical guarantees for the special case when the feature representation is d-dimensional and fixed. We provide the Bayesian regret of posterior sampling {RL} ({PSRL}) and frequentist regret of the optimism in the face of uncertainty ({OFU}) for episodic {MDPs}.},

	abstract = {We study the problem of off-policy evaluation ({OPE}) in reinforcement learning ({RL}), where the goal is to estimate the performance of a policy from the data generated by another policy(ies). In particular, we focus on the doubly robust ({DR}) estimators that consist of an importance sampling ({IS}) component and a performance model, and utilize the low (or zero) bias of {IS} and low variance of the model at the same time. Although the accuracy of the model has a huge impact on the overall performance of {DR}, most of the work on using the {DR} estimators in {OPE} has been focused on improving the {IS} part, and not much on how to learn the model. In this paper, we propose alternative {DR} estimators, called more robust doubly robust ({MRDR}), that learn the model parameter by minimizing the variance of the {DR} estimator. We first present a formulation for learning the {DR} model in {RL}. We then derive formulas for the variance of the {DR} estimator in both contextual bandits and {RL}, such that their gradients w.r.t.{\textasciitilde}the model parameters can be estimated from the samples, and propose methods to efficiently minimize the variance. We prove that the {MRDR} estimators are strongly consistent and asymptotically optimal. Finally, we evaluate {MRDR} in bandits and {RL} benchmark problems, and compare its performance with the existing methods.},

Such constraints have proven very useful in previous structured prediction approaches, but it is a challenge to introduce them into a deep learning framework.

	abstract = {In reinforcement learning an agent interacts with the environment by taking actions and observing the next state and reward. When sampled probabilistically, these state transitions, rewards, and actions can all induce randomness in the observed long-term return. Traditionally, reinforcement learning algorithms average over this randomness to estimate the value function. In this paper, we build on recent work advocating a distributional approach to reinforcement learning in which the distribution over returns is modeled explicitly instead of only estimating the mean. That is, we examine methods of learning the value distribution instead of the value function. We give results that close a number of gaps between the theoretical and algorithmic results given by Bellemare, Dabney, and Munos (2017). First, we extend existing results to the approximate distribution setting. Second, we present a novel distributional reinforcement learning algorithm consistent with our theoretical formulation. Finally, we evaluate this new algorithm on the Atari 2600 games, observing that it significantly outperforms many of the recent improvements on {DQN}, including the related distributional algorithm C51.},

Most academic research is concerned with approaches that personalize the recommendations according to long-term user profiles.

Given the high practical relevance of the problem, an increased interest in this problem can be observed in recent years, leading to a number of proposals for session-based recommendation algorithms that typically aim to predict the user's immediate next actions. In this work, we present the results of an in-depth performance comparison of a number of such algorithms, using a variety of datasets and evaluation measures. Our comparison includes the most recent approaches based on recurrent neural networks like {GRU}4REC, factorized Markov model approaches such as {FISM} or Fossil, as well as more simple methods based, e.g., on nearest neighbor schemes. Our experiments reveal that algorithms of this latter class, despite their sometimes almost trivial nature, often perform equally well or significantly better than today's more complex approaches based on deep neural networks. Our results therefore suggest that there is substantial room for improvement regarding the development of more sophisticated session-based recommendation algorithms.},

	abstract = {In machine learning, the notion of multi-armed bandits refers to a class of online learning problems, in which an agent is supposed to simultaneously explore and exploit a given set of choice alternatives in the course of a sequential decision process. In the standard setting, the agent learns from stochastic feedback in the form of real-valued rewards. In many applications, however, numerical reward signals are not readily available -- instead, only weaker information is provided, in particular relative preferences in the form of qualitative comparisons between pairs of alternatives. This observation has motivated the study of variants of the multi-armed bandit problem, in which more general representations are used both for the type of feedback to learn from and the target of prediction. The aim of this paper is to provide a survey of the state of the art in this field, referred to as preference-based multi-armed bandits or dueling bandits. To this end, we provide an overview of problems that have been considered in the literature as well as methods for tackling them. Our taxonomy is mainly based on the assumptions made by these methods about the data-generating process and, related to this, the properties of the preference-based feedback.},

This enables recommendations for new, unseen content, and may generalize better, since the factors for all items are produced by a compactly-parametrized model. Previous work has used topic models or averages of word embeddings for this mapping. In this paper we present a method leveraging deep recurrent neural networks to encode the text sequence into a latent vector, specifically gated recurrent units ({GRUs}) trained end-to-end on the collaborative filtering task. For the task of scientific paper recommendation, this yields models with significantly higher accuracy. In cold-start scenarios, we beat the previous state-of-the-art, all of which ignore word order. Performance is further improved by multi-task learning, where the text encoder network is trained for a combination of content recommendation and item metadata prediction.

Exploitation recommends content (e.g., products, movies, music playlists) with the highest predicted user engagement and has traditionally been the focus of recommender systems. Exploration recommends content with uncertain predicted user engagement for the purpose of gathering more information. The importance of exploration has been recognized in recent years, particularly in settings with new users, new items, non-stationary preferences and attributes. In parallel, explaining recommendations ("recsplanations") is crucial if users are to understand their recommendations. Existing work has looked at bandits and explanations independently. We provide the first method that combines both in a principled manner. In particular, our method is able to jointly (1) learn which explanations each user responds to; (2) learn the best content to recommend for each user; and (3) balance exploration with exploitation to deal with uncertainty. Experiments with historical log data and tests with live production traffic in a large-scale music recommendation service show a significant improvement in user engagement.},

Even though these methods are designed for the item prediction task of personalized ranking, none of them is directly optimized for ranking. In this paper we present a generic optimization criterion {BPR}-Opt for personalized ranking that is the maximum posterior estimator derived from a Bayesian analysis of the problem. We also provide a generic learning algorithm for optimizing models with respect to {BPR}-Opt. The learning method is based on stochastic gradient descent with bootstrap sampling. We show how to apply our method to two state-of-the-art recommender models: matrix factorization and adaptive {kNN}. Our experiments indicate that for the task of per-sonalized ranking our optimization method outperforms the standard learning techniques for {MF} and {kNN}. The results show the importance of optimizing models for the right criterion.},

We first explain the framework with a deep probit regression model, which is trained with probabilistic back-propagation in the mode of assumed Gaussian density filtering. Then we extend the model family to a variety of bayesian online models with increasing feature embedding capabilities, such as Sparse-{MLP}, {FM}-{MLP} and {FFM}-{MLP}. Finally, we implement a parallel training system based on a stream computing infrastructure and parameter servers. Experiments with public available datasets and Tencent industrial datasets show that models within our framework perform better than several common online models, such as {AdPredictor}, {FTRL}-Proximal and {MatchBox}. Online A/B test within Tencent advertising system further proves that our framework could achieve {CTR} and {CPM} lift by learning more quickly and accurately.},

Firstly, we show that a simple adaptation of truncated backpropagation through time can yield good quality uncertainty estimates and superior regularisation at only a small extra computational cost during training, also reducing the amount of parameters by 80\%. Secondly, we demonstrate how a novel kind of posterior approximation yields further improvements to the performance of Bayesian {RNNs}. We incorporate local gradient information into the approximate posterior to sharpen it around the current batch statistics. We show how this technique is not exclusive to recurrent neural networks and can be applied more widely to train Bayesian neural networks. We also empirically demonstrate how Bayesian {RNNs} are superior to traditional {RNNs} on a language modelling benchmark and an image captioning task, as well as showing how each of these methods improve our model over a variety of other schemes for training them. We also introduce a new benchmark for studying uncertainty for language models so future methods can be easily compared.},

Academic research in the field is historically often based on the matrix completion problem formulation, where for each user-item-pair only one interaction (e.g., a rating) is considered. In many application domains, however, multiple user-item interactions of different types can be recorded over time. And, a number of recent works have shown that this information can be used to build richer individual user models and to discover additional behavioral patterns that can be leveraged in the recommendation process. In this work we review existing works that consider information from such sequentially-ordered user- item interaction logs in the recommendation process. Based on this review, we propose a categorization of the corresponding recommendation tasks and goals, summarize existing algorithmic solutions, discuss methodological approaches when benchmarking what we call sequence-aware recommender systems, and outline open challenges in the area.},

Real-life recommender systems often face the problem of having to base recommendations only on short session-based data (e.g. a small sportsware website) instead of long user histories (as in the case of Netflix). In this situation the frequently praised matrix factorization approaches are not accurate. This problem is usually overcome in practice by resorting to item-to-item recommendations, i.e. recommending similar items. We argue that by modeling the whole session, more accurate recommendations can be provided. We therefore propose an {RNN}-based approach for session-based recommendations. Our approach also considers practical aspects of the task and introduces several modifications to classic {RNNs} such as a ranking loss function that make it more viable for this specific problem. Experimental results on two data-sets show marked improvements over widely used approaches.},

Here we investigate how these features can be exploited in Recurrent Neural Network based session models using deep learning. We show that obvious approaches do not leverage these data sources. We thus introduce a number of parallel {RNN} ({pRNN}) architectures to model sessions based on the clicks and the features (images and text) of the clicked items. We also propose alternative training strategies for {pRNNs} that suit them better than standard training.

However, when the number of possible outcomes is very large, using categorical distributions becomes computationally expensive, as the complexity scales linearly with the number of outcomes. To address this problem, we propose augment and reduce (A\&R), a method to alleviate the computational complexity. A\&R uses two ideas: latent variable augmentation and stochastic variational inference. It maximizes a lower bound on the marginal likelihood of the data. Unlike existing methods which are specific to softmax, A\&R is more general and is amenable to other categorical models, such as multinomial probit. On several large-scale classification problems, we show that A\&R provides a tighter bound on the marginal likelihood and has better predictive performance than existing approaches.},

We introduce a recurrent version of the {VAE}, where instead of passing a subset of the whole history regardless of temporal dependencies, we rather pass the consumption sequence subset through a recurrent neural network. At each time-step of the {RNN}, the sequence is fed through a series of fully-connected layers, the output of which models the probability distribution of the most likely future preferences. We show that handling temporal information is crucial for improving the accuracy of the {VAE}: In fact, our model beats the current state-of-the-art by valuable margins because of its ability to capture temporal dependencies among the user-consumption sequence using the recurrent encoder still keeping the fundamentals of variational autoencoders intact.},

We show {PL} Trees can accelerate convergence of {GBDT}. Moreover, our new algorithm fits better to modern computer architectures with powerful Single Instruction Multiple Data ({SIMD}) parallelism. We propose optimization techniques to speedup our algorithm.

	abstract = {With the recent prevalence of Reinforcement Learning ({RL}), there have been tremendous interests in developing {RL}-based recom-mender systems, which enjoy two major advantages-(i) they can continuously improve their recommendation strategies based on users' real-time feedback, and (ii) the optimal recommendation strategies aim to maximize the cumulative reward from users in the long run, e.g., the total revenue of a recommendation session. In practical recommendation sessions, users will sequentially access multiple scenarios, such as the entrance pages and the item detail pages, and each scenario has its own recommendation strategy. However, the majority of existing {RL}-based recommender systems focus on separately optimizing each strategy, which could lead to sub-optimal overall performance, because independently optimizing each scenario (i) overlooks the sequential correlation among scenarios, (ii) ignores users' behavior data from other scenarios, and (iii) only optimizes its own objective but neglects the overall objective of a session. Therefore, in this paper, we study the recommendation problem with multiple (consecutive) scenarios, i.e., whole-chain recommendations. We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning based approach ({DeepChain}), which can capture the sequential correlation among different scenarios and jointly optimize multiple recommendation strategies. To be specific, all recommender agents share the same memory of users' historical behaviors, and they work collaboratively to maximize the overall reward of a session. Note that optimizing multiple recommendation strategies jointly faces two challenges-(i) it requires huge amounts of user behavior data, and (ii) the distribution of reward (users' feedback) are extremely unbalanced. In this paper, we introduce model-based reinforcement learning techniques to reduce the training data requirement and execute more accurate strategy updates. The experimental results based on data from a real e-commerce platform demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

	abstract = {Ranking is a central task in machine learning and information retrieval. In this task, it is especially important to present the user with a slate of items that is appealing as a whole. This in turn requires taking into account interactions between items, since intuitively, placing an item on the slate affects the decision of which other items should be placed alongside it. In this work, we propose a sequence-to-sequence model for ranking called seq2slate. At each step, the model predicts the next “best” item to place on the slate given the items already selected. The sequential nature of the model allows complex dependencies between the items to be captured directly in a flexible and scalable way. We show how to learn the model end-to-end from weak supervision in the form of easily obtained click-through data. We further demonstrate the usefulness of our approach in experiments on standard ranking benchmarks as well as in a real-world recommendation system.},

We first discuss models and methods for Bayesian inference in the simple single-step Bandit model. We then review the extensive recent literature on Bayesian methods for model-based {RL}, where prior information can be expressed on the parameters of the Markov model. We also present Bayesian methods for model-free {RL}, where priors are expressed over the value function or policy class. The objective of the paper is to provide a comprehensive survey on Bayesian {RL} algorithms and their theoretical and empirical properties.},

With the strongly increased interest in machine learning in general, it has, as a result, become difficult to keep track of what represents the state-of-the-art at the moment, e.g., for top-n recommendation tasks. At the same time, several recent publications point out problems in today's research practice in applied machine learning, e.g., in terms of the reproducibility of the results or the choice of the baselines when proposing new models. In this work, we report the results of a systematic analysis of algorithmic proposals for top-n recommendation tasks. Specifically, we considered 18 algorithms that were presented at top-level research conferences in the last years. Only 7 of them could be reproduced with reasonable effort. For these methods, it however turned out that 6 of them can often be outperformed with comparably simple heuristic methods, e.g., based on nearest-neighbor or graph-based techniques. The remaining one clearly outperformed the baselines but did not consistently outperform a well-tuned non-neural linear ranking method. Overall, our work sheds light on a number of potential problems in today's machine learning scholarship and calls for improved scientific practices in this area.

	abstract = {Caveat: These are notes used to teach from. They are neither carefully constructed nor comprehensive. These notes were the backbone of a day-long session with objective to introduce people to the basic building blocks of reinforcement learning. This was the theory part, while Jupyter notebooks were provided to help people experiment with the methods. The standard start-point for {RL} is Sutton and Barto (1998). 1 Basic bandit algorithms At each time t ∈ N a decision-maker selects an action/arm a t in a finite set A, then receives a reward R t ∼ ν at with expected value r(a t). Rewards are independent across time steps, and all rewards from action a are identically distributed (ie no temporal dependence). The decision-maker does not know ν a or r(a) in advance. The objective is to maximise the cumulative reward. It is necessary for the decision-maker to trade off exploring, to find out information about the reward distributions, with explointing, selecting actions which are known to perform well in order to gain reward. This is a fundamental problem in all online learning/acting frameworks, and the bandit problem is a simple framework in which to investigate the explore-exploit dilemna. At time t, a natural estimator of r(a) is the average reward received so far when action a has been played. Let N t (a) = t s=1 I as=a denote the number of times action a has been played up to time t, and let Q t (a) = N t (a) −1 t s=1 I at=a R t be the average reward. (Probably) every policy discussed here will use the Q t (a) values to select an action at time t + 1. Note that these can be maintained in an online fashion, so that the full history need not be retained: basic algebraic manipulations show that Q t (a) = Q t−1 (a) + I at=a 1 N t (a) \{R t − Q t−1 (a)\}. A very poor policy is the greedy policy, for which a t+1 ∈ argmax a Q t (a). This policy performs no exploration at all, and if the optimal action happens to give a poor reward on the first try it may never get selected ever again. A slight improvement is the-greedy algorithm, which on each time step selects the greedy action with probability 1 − , and otherwise selects an action uniformly at random.-greedy carries out sufficient exploration to ensure that eventually the greedy action is indeed the optimal action (i.e. argmax a r(a)). However there is always a fixed probability of playing an arbitrary suboptimal action, so action selection can never converge to the optimal.},

This problem arises in many settings, for example in product recommendation when after a user makes a purchase, we wish to wait before suggesting the same product again. In the recovering bandits problem, the reward at time t depends on all previous actions, so finding the optimal sequence of T actions would be infeasible. In this paper, we discuss alternative strategies which perform well theoretically and experimentally. Specifically, we assume the recovery functions take the form of a Gaussian process and present {UCB} and Thompson Sampling algorithms which achieve high instantaneous reward (reward from the played arm) and lookahead reward (total reward from the next d arms).},

While these models are demonstrably useful for agents, every naturally occurring model of the world of which we are aware-e.g., a brain-arose as the byproduct of competing evolutionary pressures for survival, not minimization of a supervised forward-predictive loss via gradient descent. That useful models can arise out of the messy and slow optimization process of evolution suggests that forward-predictive modeling can arise as a side-effect of optimization under the right circumstances. Crucially, this optimization process need not explicitly be a forward-predictive loss. In this work, we provide an example modification to traditional reinforcement learning we call observational dropout, whereby we artificially constrain the probability that an agent is allowed to observe its real environment at each step. In doing so, we can coerce an agent into learning a world model to fill in the observation gaps during reinforcement learning. We show that the emerged world model, while not explicitly trained to predict the future, can help the agent learn key skills required to perform well in its environment.},

While the general form of the reinforcement learning problem enables effective reasoning about uncertainty, the connection between reinforcement learning and inference in probabilistic models is not immediately obvious. However, such a connection has considerable value when it comes to algorithm design: formalizing a problem as probabilistic inference in principle allows us to bring to bear a wide array of approximate inference tools, extend the model in flexible and powerful ways, and reason about compositionality and partial observability. In this article, we will discuss how a generalization of the reinforcement learning or optimal control problem, which is sometimes termed maximum entropy reinforcement learning, is equivalent to exact probabilistic inference in the case of deterministic dynamics, and variational inference in the case of stochastic dynamics. We will present a detailed derivation of this framework, overview prior work that has drawn on this and related ideas to propose new reinforcement learning and control algorithms, and describe perspectives on future research.},

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning ({RL}) combines a control problem with statistical estimation: the system dynamics are not known to the agent, but can be learned through experience. A recent line of research casts `{RL} as inference' and suggests a particular framework to generalize the {RL} problem as probabilistic inference. Our paper surfaces a key shortcoming in that approach, and clarifies the sense in which {RL} can be coherently cast as an inference problem. In particular, an {RL} agent must consider the effects of its actions upon future rewards and observations: the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. In all but the most simple settings, the resulting inference is computationally intractable so that practical {RL} algorithms must resort to approximation. We demonstrate that the popular `{RL} as inference' approximation can perform poorly in even very basic problems. However, we show that with a small modification the framework does yield algorithms that can provably perform well, and we show that the resulting algorithm is equivalent to the recently proposed K-learning, which we further connect with Thompson sampling.},

Previous methods mainly focus on optimizing recommendation accuracy. However, they usually ignore the diversity of the recommendation results, thus usually results in unsatisfying user experiences. In this paper, we propose a novel diversified recommendation model, named Diversified Contextual Combinatorial Bandit ({DC}\${\textasciicircum}2\$B), for interactive recommendation with users' implicit feedback. Specifically, {DC}\${\textasciicircum}2\$B employs determinantal point process in the recommendation procedure to promote diversity of the recommendation results. To learn the model parameters, a Thompson sampling-type algorithm based on variational Bayesian inference is proposed. In addition, theoretical regret analysis is also provided to guarantee the performance of {DC}\${\textasciicircum}2\$B.

	abstract = {Variational methods are a key component of the approximate inference and learning toolbox. These methods fill an important middle ground, retaining distributional information about uncertainty in latent variables, unlike maximum a posteriori methods, and yet generally requiring less computational time than Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. In particular the variational expectation maximisation ({vEM}) and variational Bayes algorithms, both involving variational optimisation of a free-energy, are widely used in time series modelling. Here, we investigate the success of {vEM} in simple probabilistic time series models. First we consider the inference step of {vEM}, and show that a consequence of the well-known compactness property of variational inference is a failure to propagate uncertainty in time, thus limiting the usefulness of the retained distributional information. In particular, the uncertainty may appear to be smallest precisely when the approximation is poorest. Second, we consider parameter learning and analytically reveal systematic biases in the parameters found by {vEM}. Surprisingly, simpler variational approximations (such as mean-field) can lead to less bias than more complicated structured approximations. The variational approach. We begin this chapter with a brief theoretical review of the variational expectation maximisation algorithm, before illustrating the important concepts with a simple example in the next section. The {vEM} algorithm is an approximate version of the expectation maximisation ({EM}) algorithm [4]. Expectation maximisation is a standard approach to finding maximum likelihood ({ML}) parameters for latent variable models, including hidden Markov models and linear or non-linear state space models ({SSMs}) for time series.},

	abstract = {Blockchains, and specifically smart contracts, have promised to create fair and transparent trading ecosystems. Unfortunately, we show that this promise has not been met. We document and quantify the widespread and rising deployment of arbitrage bots in blockchain systems, specifically in decentralized exchanges (or "{DEXes}"). Like high-frequency traders on Wall Street, these bots exploit inefficiencies in {DEXes}, paying high transaction fees and optimizing network latency to frontrun, i.e., anticipate and exploit, ordinary users' {DEX} trades. We study the breadth of {DEX} arbitrage bots in a subset of transactions that yield quantifiable revenue to these bots. We also study bots' profit-making strategies, with a focus on blockchain-specific elements. We observe bots engage in what we call priority gas auctions ({PGAs}), competitively bidding up transaction fees in order to obtain priority ordering, i.e., early block position and execution, for their transactions. {PGAs} present an interesting and complex new continuous-time, partial-information, game-theoretic model that we formalize and study. We release an interactive web portal, http://frontrun.me/, to provide the community with real-time data on {PGAs}. We additionally show that high fees paid for priority transaction ordering poses a systemic risk to consensus-layer security. We explain that such fees are just one form of a general phenomenon in {DEXes} and beyond---what we call miner extractable value ({MEV})---that poses concrete, measurable, consensus-layer security risks. We show empirically that {MEV} poses a realistic threat to Ethereum today. Our work highlights the large, complex risks created by transaction-ordering dependencies in smart contracts and the ways in which traditional forms of financial-market exploitation are adapting to and penetrating blockchain economies.},

In practice, however, Bayesian matrix factorization suffers from cold-start problems, where inferences are required for users or items about which a sufficient number of ratings are not gathered. In this paper we present a method for Bayesian matrix factorization with side information, to handle cold-start problems. To this end, we place Gaussian-Wishart priors on mean vectors and precision matrices of Gaussian user and item factor matrices, such that mean of each prior distribution is regressed on corresponding side information. We develop variational inference algorithms to approximately compute posterior distributions over user and item factor matrices. In addition, we provide Bayesian Cramér-Rao Bound for our model, showing that the hierarchical Bayesian matrix factorization with side information improves the reconstruction over the standard Bayesian matrix factorization where the side information is not used. Experiments on {MovieLens} data demonstrate the useful behavior of our model in the case of cold-start problems.},

The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of using search traffic information to analyze actual consumer attitudes regarding a product. By comparing the results of conventional survey-based attitude research with the results of search traffic information, this study reveals that search traffic information indicates consumers' level of interest regarding a product, the product attributes that they are considering, and the importance of each attribute to them. Also, it demonstrates the potential benefits of search traffic analysis, which can be useful for forecasting consumer preferences regarding products. Focusing on the Prius, a hybrid car, this study shows that search traffic information serves as an accurate indicator of consumer attitudes, and even succeeds in identifying consumers' hidden attitudes toward the Prius, which can be explained by cognitive dissonance theory. Finally, this study utilizes search traffic information to forecast changes in consumer attitudes and to develop an econometric model of consumer demand for the Prius by incorporating environmental variables such as the {WTI} (West Texas Intermediate) price. This study concludes that search traffic information offers new potential advantages, in that it not only overcomes the limitations imposed by the high cost of conducting surveys, in terms of money and time, but also helps to reduce the distortions caused by conscious or unconscious errors committed by survey respondents. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

In this paper, we propose a Hidden Hierarchical Matrix Factorization ({HHMF}) technique, which learns the hidden hierarchical structure from the user-item rating records. {HHMF} does not require the prior knowledge of hierarchical structure; hence, as opposed to existing hierarchical {MF} methods, {HHMF} can be applied when this information is either explicit or implicit.

Recommender systems have been developed to tackle the item targeting problem.

Following state-of-the-art methods, a distinction is made between content-based recommender approaches and collaborative filtering-based recommender approaches. Collaborative filtering-based recommender approaches are the most widely adopted methods. They are divided into memory-based methods that show the advantage of their easy-understandability, and model-based methods that are data sparsity resilient and high-accurate. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model-based recommendation approach, a combination of a user-based approach and an item-based approach. Our method estimates the probability with which a user would rate an item. It performs a Bayesian inference of future end-user interests and shows the advantage of the easy-understandability of memory-based methods and the effectiveness of model-based methods.

This causes a newly trained model to act greedily and favor items that have already been engaged by users. This behavior is particularly harmful in personalised ads recommendations, as it can also cause new campaigns to remain unexplored. Exploration aims to address this limitation by providing new information about the environment, which encompasses user preference, and can lead to higher long-term reward. In this work, we formulate a display advertising recommender as a contextual bandit and implement exploration techniques that require sampling from the posterior distribution of click-through-rates in a computationally tractable manner. Traditional large-scale deep learning models do not provide uncertainty estimates by default. We approximate these uncertainty measurements of the predictions by employing a bootstrapped model with multiple heads and dropout units. We benchmark a number of different models in an offline simulation environment using a publicly available dataset of user-ads engagements. We test our proposed deep Bayesian bandits algorithm in the offline simulation and online {AB} setting with large-scale production traffic, where we demonstrate a positive gain of our exploration model.},

We show that this principled kind of regularisation yields comparable performance to dropout on {MNIST} classification. We then demonstrate how the learnt uncertainty in the weights can be used to improve generalisation in non-linear regression problems, and how this weight uncertainty can be used to drive the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning.},

However, deriving a variational inference algorithm generally requires significant model-specific analysis. These efforts can hinder and deter us from quickly developing and exploring a variety of models for a problem at hand. In this paper, we present a "black box" variational inference algorithm, one that can be quickly applied to many models with little additional derivation. Our method is based on a stochastic optimization of the variational objective where the noisy gradient is computed from Monte Carlo samples from the variational distribution. We develop a number of methods to reduce the variance of the gradient, always maintaining the criterion that we want to avoid difficult model-based derivations. We evaluate our method against the corresponding black box sampling based methods. We find that our method reaches better predictive likelihoods much faster than sampling methods. Finally, we demonstrate that Black Box Variational Inference lets us easily explore a wide space of models by quickly constructing and evaluating several models of longitudinal healthcare data.},

This results in a gap between the final recommendation objective and the classical setup where recommendation candidates are evaluated by their coherence with past user behavior, by predicting either the missing entries in the user-item matrix, or the most likely next event. To bridge this gap, we optimize a recommendation policy for the task of increasing the desired outcome versus the organic user behavior. We show this is equivalent to learning to predict recommendation outcomes under a fully random recommendation policy. To this end, we propose a new domain adaptation algorithm that learns from logged data containing outcomes from a biased recommendation policy and predicts recommendation outcomes according to random exposure. We compare our method against state-of-the-art factorization methods, in addition to new approaches of causal recommendation and show significant improvements.},

The sparsity of the items by user matrix and the cold-start issue in marketplaces pose challenges for the off-the-shelf matrix factorization based recommender systems. To understand user intent and tailor recommendations to their needs, we use deep learning to explore various heterogeneous data available in marketplaces. This paper summarizes five lessons we learned from experimenting with stateof-the-art deep learning recommenders at the leading Norwegian marketplace {FINN}.no.We design a hybrid recommender system that takes the user-generated content of a marketplace (including text, images and meta attributes) and combines it with user behavior data such as page views and messages to provide recommendations for marketplace items. Among various tactics we experimented with, the following five show the best impact: Staged training instead of end-to-end training, leveraging rich user behaviors beyond page views, using user behaviors as noisy labels to train embeddings, using transfer learning to solve the unbalanced data problem, and using attention mechanisms in the hybrid model. This system is currently running with around 20\% click-through-rate in production at {FINN}.no and serves over one million visitors everyday.},

To address the former challenge, we present an algorithm capable of learning arbitrary nonlinear cost functions, such as neural networks, without meticulous feature engineering.

Despite widespread use in language modeling and economics, the multinomial likelihood receives less attention in the recommender systems literature. We introduce a different regularization parameter for the learning objective, which proves to be crucial for achieving competitive performance. Remarkably, there is an efficient way to tune the parameter using annealing. The resulting model and learning algorithm has information-theoretic connections to maximum entropy discrimination and the information bottleneck principle. Empirically, we show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines, including two recently-proposed neural network approaches, on several real-world datasets.

Instead, learning the tasks jointly enables us to effectively increase the amount of labeled training data. In this paper, we formulate a kernelized Bayesian transfer learning framework that is a principled combination of kernel-based dimensionality reduction models with task-specific projection matrices to find a shared subspace and a coupled classification model for all of the tasks in this subspace. Our two main contributions are: (i) two novel probabilistic models for binary and multiclass classification, and (ii) very efficient variational approximation procedures for these models. We illustrate the generalization performance of our algorithms on two different applications. In computer vision experiments, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms on nine out of 12 benchmark supervised domain adaptation experiments defined on two object recognition data sets. In cancer biology experiments, we use our algorithm to predict mutation status of important cancer genes from gene expression profiles using two distinct cancer populations, namely, patient-derived primary tumor data and in-vitro-derived cancer cell line data.

	volume = {41},
	abstract = {Variational inference ({VI}) combined with data subsampling enables approximate posterior inference over large data sets, but suffers from poor local optima. We first formulate a deterministic annealing approach for the generic class of conditionally conjugate exponential family models. This approach uses a decreasing temperature parameter which deterministically deforms the objective during the course of the optimization. A well-known drawback to this annealing approach is the choice of the cooling schedule. We therefore introduce variational tempering, a variational algorithm that introduces a temperature latent variable to the model. In contrast to related work in the Markov chain Monte Carlo literature, this algorithm results in adaptive annealing schedules. Lastly, we develop local variational tempering, which assigns a latent temperature to each data point; this allows for dynamic annealing that varies across data. Compared to the traditional {VI}, all proposed approaches find improved predictive likelihoods on held-out data.},

	abstract = {The goal of text ranking is to generate an ordered list of texts retrieved from a corpus in response to a query. Although the most common formulation of text ranking is search, instances of the task can also be found in many natural language processing applications. This survey provides an overview of text ranking with neural network architectures known as transformers, of which {BERT} is the best-known example. The combination of transformers and self-supervised pretraining has, without exaggeration, revolutionized the fields of natural language processing ({NLP}), information retrieval ({IR}), and beyond. In this survey, we provide a synthesis of existing work as a single point of entry for practitioners who wish to gain a better understanding of how to apply transformers to text ranking problems and researchers who wish to pursue work in this area. We cover a wide range of modern techniques, grouped into two high-level categories: transformer models that perform reranking in multi-stage ranking architectures and learned dense representations that attempt to perform ranking directly. There are two themes that pervade our survey: techniques for handling long documents, beyond the typical sentence-by-sentence processing approaches used in {NLP}, and techniques for addressing the tradeoff between effectiveness (result quality) and efficiency (query latency). Although transformer architectures and pretraining techniques are recent innovations, many aspects of how they are applied to text ranking are relatively well understood and represent mature techniques. However, there remain many open research questions, and thus in addition to laying out the foundations of pretrained transformers for text ranking, this survey also attempts to prognosticate where the field is heading.},

However, as we show in this article, {CML} requires large batches to work reasonably well because of a too simplistic uniform negative sampling strategy for selecting triplets. Due to memory limitations, this makes it difficult to scale in high-dimensional scenarios. To alleviate this problem, we propose here a 2-stage negative sampling strategy which finds triplets that are highly informative for learning. Our strategy allows {CML} to work effectively in terms of accuracy and popularity bias, even when the batch size is an order of magnitude smaller than what would be needed with the default uniform sampling. We demonstrate the suitability of the proposed strategy for recommendation and exhibit consistent positive results across various datasets.},

Conventionally, user general taste and recent demand are combined to promote recommendation performances. However, existing methods often neglect that user long-term preference keep evolving over time, and building a static representation for user general taste may not adequately reflect the dynamic characters. Moreover, they integrate user-item or itemitem interactions through a linear way which limits the capability of model. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel two-layer hierarchical attention network, which takes the above properties into account, to recommend the next item user might be interested. Specifically, the first attention layer learns user long-term preferences based on the historical purchased item representation, while the second one outputs final user representation through coupling user long-term and short-term preferences. The experimental study demonstrates the superiority of our method compared with other state-of-the-art ones.},

We find a mean specific net mass balance of -257mmw.e. yr-1, corresponding to a mean annual mass loss of about 8.7 Gt, with large interannual variability. Our results are compared with a comprehensive set of mass balance, meteorological, and satellite measurements. Model temperature biases of 0.19 and -1.9 °C are found at two glacier automatic weather station sites. Simulated climatic mass balance is mostly within about 100mmw.e. yr-1 of stake measurements, and simulated winter accumulation at the Austfonna ice cap shows mean absolute errors of 47 and 67mmw.e. yr-1 when compared to radar-derived values for the selected years 2004 and 2006. Comparison of modeled surface height changes from 2003 to 2008, and satellite altimetry reveals good agreement in both mean values and regional differences. The largest deviations from observations are found for winter accumulation at Hansbreen (up to around 1000mmw.e. yr-1), a site where sub-grid topography and wind redistribution of snow are important factors. Comparison with simulations using 9 km grid spacing reveal considerable differences on regional and local scales. In addition, 3 km grid spacing allows for a much more detailed comparison with observations than what is possible with 9 km grid spacing. Further decreasing the grid spacing to 1 km appears to be less significant, although in general precipitation amounts increase with resolution. Altogether, the model compares well with observations and offers possibilities for studying glacier climatic mass balance on Svalbard both historically as well as based on climate projections.},

Learning from the logged feedback is however subject to biases caused by only observing feedback on recommendations selected by the previous versions of the recommender. In this work, we present a general recipe of addressing such biases in a production top-K recommender system at {YouTube}, built with a policy-gradient-based algorithm, i.e. {REINFORCE} [48]. The contributions of the paper are: (1) scaling {REINFORCE} to a production recommender system with an action space on the orders of millions; (2) applying off-policy correction to address data biases in learning from logged feedback collected from multiple behavior policies; (3) proposing a novel top-K off-policy correction to account for our policy recommending multiple items at a time; (4) showcasing the value of exploration.

While these models are demonstrably useful for agents, every naturally occurring model of the world of which we are aware-e.g., a brain-arose as the byproduct of competing evolutionary pressures for survival, not minimization of a supervised forward-predictive loss via gradient descent. That useful models can arise out of the messy and slow optimization process of evolution suggests that forward-predictive modeling can arise as a side-effect of optimization under the right circumstances. Crucially, this optimization process need not explicitly be a forward-predictive loss. In this work, we introduce a modification to traditional reinforcement learning which we call observational dropout, whereby we limit the agents ability to observe the real environment at each timestep. In doing so, we can coerce an agent into learning a world model to fill in the observation gaps during reinforcement learning. We show that the emerged world model, while not explicitly trained to predict the future, can help the agent learn key skills required to perform well in its environment.

The popularity of such methods has grown significantly in recen-t years. However, a limitation of {HMC} methods is the required gradient computation for simulation of the Hamiltonian dynamical system - such computation is infeasible in problems involving a large sample size or streaming data. Instead, we must rely on a noisy gradient estimate computed from a subset of the data. In this paper, we explore the properties of such a stochastic gradient {HMC} approach. Surprisingly, the natural implementation of the stochastic approximation can be arbitrarily bad. To address this problem we introduce a variant that uses second-order Langevin dynamics with a friction term that counteracts the effects of the noisy gradient, maintaining the desired target distribution as the invariant distribution. Results on simulated data validate our theory. We also provide an application of our methods to a classification task using neural networks and to online Bayesian matrix factorization.},

	abstract = {In session-based or sequential recommendation, it is important to consider a number of factors like long-term user engagement, multiple types of user-item interactions such as clicks, purchases etc. The current state-of-the-art supervised approaches fail to model them appropriately. Casting sequential recommendation task as a reinforcement learning ({RL}) problem is a promising direction. A major component of {RL} approaches is to train the agent through interactions with the environment. However, it is often problematic to train a recommender in an on-line fashion due to the requirement to expose users to irrelevant recommendations. As a result, learning the policy from logged implicit feedback is of vital importance, which is challenging due to the pure off-policy setting and lack of negative rewards (feedback). In this paper, we propose self-supervised reinforcement learning for sequential recommendation tasks. Our approach augments standard recommendation models with two output layers: one for self-supervised learning and the other for {RL}. The {RL} part acts as a regularizer to drive the supervised layer focusing on specific rewards (e.g., recommending items which may lead to purchases rather than clicks) while the self-supervised layer with cross-entropy loss provides strong gradient signals for parameter updates. Based on such an approach, we propose two frameworks namely Self-Supervised Q-learning ({SQN}) and Self-Supervised Actor-Critic ({SAC}). We integrate the proposed frameworks with four state-of-the-art recommendation models. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

	abstract = {Variational Bayesian neural networks ({BNNs}) perform variational inference over weights, but it is difficult to specify meaningful priors and approximate posteriors in a high-dimensional weight space. We introduce functional variational Bayesian neural networks ({fBNNs}), which maximize an Evidence Lower {BOund} ({ELBO}) defined directly on stochastic processes, i.e. distributions over functions. We prove that the {KL} divergence between stochastic processes equals the supremum of marginal {KL} divergences over all finite sets of inputs. Based on this, we introduce a practical training objective which approximates the functional {ELBO} using finite measurement sets and the spectral Stein gradient estimator. With {fBNNs}, we can specify priors entailing rich structures, including Gaussian processes and implicit stochastic processes. Empirically, we find {fBNNs} extrapolate well using various structured priors, provide reliable uncertainty estimates, and scale to large datasets.},

In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful generative model that learns such discrete representations. Our model, the Vector Quantised-Variational {AutoEncoder} ({VQ}-{VAE}), differs from {VAEs} in two key ways: the encoder network outputs discrete, rather than continuous, codes; and the prior is learnt rather than static. In order to learn a discrete latent representation, we incorporate ideas from vector quantisation ({VQ}). Using the {VQ} method allows the model to circumvent issues of "posterior collapse" - where the latents are ignored when they are paired with a powerful autoregressive decoder - typically observed in the {VAE} framework. Pairing these representations with an autoregressive prior, the model can generate high quality images, videos, and speech as well as doing high quality speaker conversion and unsupervised learning of phonemes, providing further evidence of the utility of the learnt representations.},

	issn = {23318422},
	abstract = {Click-through rate ({CTR}) prediction is one of the fundamental tasks for e-commerce search engines. As search becomes more personalized, it is necessary to capture the user interest from rich behavior data. Existing user behavior modeling algorithms develop different attention mechanisms to emphasize query-relevant behaviors and suppress irrelevant ones. Despite being extensively studied, these attentions still suffer from two limitations. First, conventional attentions mostly limit the attention field only to a single user’s behaviors, which is not suitable in e-commerce where users often hunt for new demands that are irrelevant to any historical behaviors. Second, these attentions are usually biased towards frequent behaviors, which is unreasonable since high frequency does not necessarily indicate great importance. To tackle the two limitations, we propose a novel attention mechanism, termed Kalman Filtering Attention ({KFAtt}), that considers the weighted pooling in attention as a maximum a posteriori ({MAP}) estimation. By incorporating a priori, {KFAtt} resorts to global statistics when few user behaviors are relevant. Moreover, a frequency capping mechanism is incorporated to correct the bias towards frequent behaviors. Offline experiments on both benchmark and a 10 billion scale real production dataset, together with an Online A/B test, show that {KFAtt} outperforms all compared state-of-the-arts. {KFAtt} has been deployed in the ranking system of {JD}.com, one of the largest B2C e-commerce websites in China, serving the main traffic of hundreds of millions of active users.},

Model-based algorithms, in principle, can provide for much more efficient learning, but have proven difficult to extend to expressive, high-capacity models such as deep neural networks. In this work, we demonstrate that neural network dynamics models can in fact be combined with model predictive control ({MPC}) to achieve excellent sample complexity in a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, producing stable and plausible gaits that accomplish various complex locomotion tasks. We further propose using deep neural network dynamics models to initialize a model-free learner, in order to combine the sample efficiency of model-based approaches with the high task-specific performance of model-free methods. We empirically demonstrate on {MuJoCo} locomotion tasks that our pure model-based approach trained on just random action data can follow arbitrary trajectories with excellent sample efficiency, and that our hybrid algorithm can accelerate model-free learning on high-speed benchmark tasks, achieving sample efficiency gains of 3-5times on swimmer, cheetah, hopper, and ant agents.

The book is available for free as a {PDF} and will remain so after publication. We’re grateful to Cambridge for allowing this. Without further ado, here is the link. Although we still have a few things we want to do, the manuscript is sufficiently polished to be useful. Of course we would greatly appreciate any comments you might have, including typos, errors in the proofs, missing references, confusing explanations or anything else you might notice. We will periodically update the book, so it would be helpful if you could quote the revision number on the cover when sending us your comments (banditalgs@gmail.com). The manuscript includes a lot of material not in the blog. The last seven chapters are all new, covering combinatorial (semi-)bandits, non-stationary bandits, ranking, pure exploration, Bayesian methods, Thompson sampling, partial monitoring and an introduction to learning in Markov decision processes. Those chapters that are based on blog posts have been cleaned up and often we have added significant depth. There is a lot of literature that we have not covered. Some of these missing topics are discussed in extreme brevity in the introduction to Part {VII}. It really is amazing how large the bandit literature has become and we’re sorry not to have found space for everything. The book includes around 250 exercises, some of which have solutions. On average the exercises have been proofread less carefully than the rest of the book, so some caution is advised. The solutions to selected exercises are available here. Finally, we’re very thankful for all the feedback already received, both on the blog and early drafts of the book.},

	abstract = {Collaborative -ltering analyzes user preferences for items (e.g., books, movies, restaurants, academic papers) by exploiting the similarity patterns across users. In implicit feedback settings, all the items, including the ones that a user did not consume, are taken into consideration. But this assumption does not accord with the common sense understanding that users have a limited scope and awareness of items. For example, a user might not have heard of a certain paper, or might live too far away from a restaurant to experience it. In the language of causal analysis [9], the assignment mechanism (i.e., the items that a user is exposed to) is a latent variable that may change for various user/item combinations. In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic approach that directly incorporates user exposure to items into collaborative ffltering. The exposure is modeled as a latent variable and the model infers its value from data. In doing so, we recover one of the most successful state-of-Theart approaches as a special case of our model [8], and provide a plug-in method for conditioning exposure on various forms of exposure covariates (e.g., topics in text, venue locations). We show that our scalable inference algorithm outperforms existing benchmarks in four difierent domains both with and without exposure covariates.},

This provides a new generic framework for approximate inference, allowing us to deploy highly complex, or implicitly defined approximation families with intractable densities, including approximations produced by warping a source of randomness through a deep neural network. Experiments consider Bayesian neural network classification and image modelling with deep generative models.

These priors are invariant to reparameterisations, have a natural connection to Jeffreys' priors, are designed to support Occam's razor and seem to have excellent robustness properties, all which are highly desirable and allow us to use this approach to define default prior distributions.

Large-scale glacier evolution models are used to project glacier runoff and mass loss, but are constrained by limited observations, which result in models being over-parameterized. Recent systematic geodetic mass-balance observations provide an opportunity to improve the calibration of glacier evolution models. In this study, we develop a calibration scheme for a glacier evolution model using a Bayesian inverse model and geodetic mass-balance observations, which enable us to quantify model parameter uncertainty. The Bayesian model is applied to each glacier in High Mountain Asia using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. After 10,000 steps, the chains generate a sufficient number of independent samples to estimate the properties of the model parameters from the joint posterior distribution. Their spatial distribution shows a clear orographic effect indicating the resolution of climate data is too coarse to resolve temperature and precipitation at high altitudes. Given the glacier evolution model is over-parameterized, particular attention is given to identifiability and the need for future work to integrate additional observations in order to better constrain the plausible sets of model parameters.},

Collaborative and content-based filtering are two basic approaches that are used in recommender systems. The former employs the feedback of users with similar interests, while the latter is based on the feature of the selected resources by each user. Recommender systems can consider users’ behavior to more accurately estimate their preferences via a list of recommendations. However, the existing approaches rarely consider both interests and preferences of the users. Also, the dynamic nature of user behavior poses an additional challenge for recommender systems. In this paper, we consider the interactions of each individual user, and analyze them to propose a user model and capture user's interests. We construct the user model based on a Bayesian nonparametric framework, called the Dirichlet Process Mixture Model. The proposed model evolves following the dynamic nature of user behavior to adapt both the user interests and preferences. We implemented the proposed model and evaluated it using both the {MovieLens} dataset, and a real-world dataset that contains news tweets from five news channels (New York Times, {BBC}, {CNN}, Reuters and Associated Press). The experimental results and comparisons with several recently developed approaches show the superiority in accuracy of the proposed approach, and its ability to adapt with user behavior over time.},

	abstract = {Many real-world recommender systems need to be highly scalable: matching millions of items with billions of users, with milliseconds latency. The scalability requirement has led to widely used two-stage recommender systems, consisting of efficient candidate generation model(s) in the first stage and a more powerful ranking model in the second stage. Logged user feedback, e.g., user clicks or dwell time, are often used to build both candidate generation and ranking models for recommender systems. While it's easy to collect large amount of such data, they are inherently biased because the feedback can only be observed on items recommended by the previous systems. Recently, off-policy correction on such biases have attracted increasing interest in the field of recommender system research. However, most existing work either assumed that the recommender system is a single-stage system or only studied how to apply off-policy correction to the candidate generation stage of the system without explicitly considering the interactions between the two stages. In this work, we propose a two-stage off-policy policy gradient method, and showcase that ignoring the interaction between the two stages leads to a sub-optimal policy in two-stage recommender systems. The proposed method explicitly takes into account the ranking model when training the candidate generation model, which helps improve the performance of the whole system. We conduct experiments on real-world datasets with large item space and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

This inference is analytic and free of local optima issues found in standard techniques such as fine-tuning neural network weights to a new task.

A system serving millions of users can learn a better user profile for a new user, or a user with little feedback, by borrowing information from other users through the use of a Bayesian hierarchical model. Learning the model parameters to optimize the joint data likelihood from millions of users is very computationally expensive. The commonly used {EM} algorithm converges very slowly due to the sparseness of the data in {IR} applications. This paper proposes a new fast learning technique to learn a large number of individual user profiles. The efficacy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm are justified by theory and demonstrated on actual user data from Netflix and {MovieLens}. Copyright 2007 {ACM}.},

	volume = {1},
	abstract = {Matrix factorization is a fundamental technique in machine learning that is applicable to collaborative filtering, information retrieval and many other areas. In collaborative filtering and many other tasks, the objective is to fill in missing elements of a sparse data matrix. One of the biggest challenges in this case is filling in a column or row of the matrix with very few observations. In this paper we introduce a Bayesian matrix factorization model that performs regression against side information known about the data in addition to the observations. The side information helps by adding observed entries to the factored matrices. We also introduce a nonpara-metric mixture model for the prior of the rows and columns of the factored matrices that gives a different regularization for each latent class. Besides providing a richer prior, the posterior distribution of mixture assignments reveals the latent classes. Using Gibbs sampling for inference, we apply our model to the Netflix Prize problem of predicting movie ratings given an incomplete user-movie ratings matrix. In-corporating rating information with gathered metadata infor-mation, our Bayesian approach outperforms other matrix fac-torization techniques even when using fewer dimensions.

	abstract = {The posterior over Bayesian neural network ({BNN}) parameters is extremely high-dimensional and non-convex. For computational reasons, researchers approximate this posterior using inexpensive mini-batch methods such as mean-field variational inference or stochastic-gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo ({SGMCMC}). To investigate foundational questions in Bayesian deep learning, we instead use full-batch Hamiltonian Monte Carlo ({HMC}) on modern architectures. We show that (1) {BNNs} can achieve significant performance gains over standard training and deep ensembles; (2) a single long {HMC} chain can provide a comparable representation of the posterior to multiple shorter chains; (3) in contrast to recent studies, we find posterior tempering is not needed for near-optimal performance, with little evidence for a "cold posterior" effect, which we show is largely an artifact of data augmentation; (4) {BMA} performance is robust to the choice of prior scale, and relatively similar for diagonal Gaussian, mixture of Gaussian, and logistic priors; (5) Bayesian neural networks show surprisingly poor generalization under domain shift; (6) while cheaper alternatives such as deep ensembles and {SGMCMC} methods can provide good generalization, they provide distinct predictive distributions from {HMC}. Notably, deep ensemble predictive distributions are similarly close to {HMC} as standard {SGLD}, and closer than standard variational inference.},

The results of experiments on the data collected from a real world microblogging service demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms stateof-the-art methods that do not consider these aspects. By taking these aspects into consideration, the relative improvement of the proposed method over the state-of-theart methods is around 12.2\% in Fl-score.},

Abstract concepts are made explicit and concrete to non-technical readers by working through the theory that gives rise to them. A publicly accessible computer program written in the statistical language R is explained line-by-line to help readers understand the computation algorithm. The algorithm is also linked to a construction method called the Chinese Restaurant Process in an accessible tutorial in this journal (Gershman and Blei, 2012). The overall goals are to help readers understand more fully the theory and application so that they may apply {BNP} methods in their own work and leverage the technical details in this tutorial to develop novel methods.},

We identify certain novel parameters of mixture models that are closely connected with the best achievable performance of a recommendation algorithm; we show that for any system in which these parameters are bounded, it is possible to give recommendations whose quality converges to optimal as the amount of data grows. All our bounds depend on a new measure of independence that can be viewed as an L1-analogue of the smallest singular value of a matrix. Using this, we introduce a technique based on generalized pseudoinverse matrices and linear programming for handling sets of high-dimensional vectors. We also show that standard approaches based on L2 spectral methods are not strong enough to yield comparable results, thereby suggesting some inherent limitations of spectral analysis.},

	abstract = {Thompson sampling is a heuristic algorithm for the multi-armed bandit problem which has a long tradition in machine learning. The algorithm has a Bayesian spirit in the sense that it selects arms based on posterior samples of reward probabilities of each arm. By forging a connection between combinatorial binary bandits and spike-and-slab variable selection, we propose a stochastic optimization approach to subset selection called Thompson Variable Selection ({TVS}). {TVS} is a framework for interpretable machine learning which does not rely on the underlying model to be linear. {TVS} brings together Bayesian reinforcement and machine learning in order to extend the reach of Bayesian subset selection to non-parametric models and large datasets with very many predictors and/or very many observations. Depending on the choice of a reward, {TVS} can be deployed in offline as well as online setups with streaming data batches. Tailoring multiplay bandits to variable selection, we provide regret bounds without necessarily assuming that the arm mean rewards be unrelated. We show a very strong empirical performance on both simulated and real data. Unlike deterministic optimization methods for spike-and-slab variable selection, the stochastic nature makes {TVS} less prone to local convergence and thereby more robust.},

As such, the collection is one of the few datasets offering the necessary data richness and scale to train neural {IR} models with a large amount of parameters, and notably the first in the health domain. Using {TripClick}, we conduct experiments to evaluate a variety of {IR} models, showing the benefits of exploiting this data to train neural architectures. In particular, the evaluation results show that the best performing neural {IR} model significantly improves the performance by a large margin relative to classical {IR} models, especially for more frequent queries.},

Three different components need to be modeled in a collaborative filtering problem: users, items, and ratings. Previous research on applying probabilistic models to collaborative filtering has shown promising results. However, there is a lack of systematic studies of different ways to model each of the three components and their interactions. In this paper, we conduct a broad and systematic study on different mixture models for collaborative filtering. We discuss general issues related to using a mixture model for collaborative filtering, and propose three properties that a graphical model is expected to satisfy. Using these properties, we thoroughly examine five different mixture models, including Bayesian Clustering ({BC}), Aspect Model ({AM}), Flexible Mixture Model ({FMM}), Joint Mixture Model ({JMM}), and the Decoupled Model ({DM}). We compare these models both analytically and experimentally. Experiments over two datasets of movie ratings under different configurations show that in general, whether a model satisfies the proposed properties tends to be correlated with its performance. In particular, the Decoupled Model, which satisfies all the three desired properties, outperforms the other mixture models as well as many other existing approaches for collaborative filtering. Our study shows that graphical models are powerful tools for modeling collaborative filtering, but careful design is necessary to achieve good performance. © Springer Science + Business Media, {LLC} 2006.},

Reinforcement learning ({RL}) methods offer the potential to optimize recommendations for long-term user engagement.

In this work, we address the challenge of making slate-based recommendations to optimize long-term value using {RL}. Our contributions are three-fold. (i) We develop {SLATEQ}, a decomposition of value-based temporal-difference and Q-learning that renders {RL} tractable with slates. Under mild assumptions on user choice behavior, we show that the long-term value ({LTV}) of a slate can be decomposed into a tractable function of its component item-wise {LTVs}. (ii) We outline a methodology that leverages existing myopic learning-based recommenders to quickly develop a recommender that handles {LTV}.

	abstract = {Recommendation systems are often evaluated based on user's interactions that were collected from an existing, already deployed recommendation system. In this situation, users only provide feedback on the exposed items and they may not leave feedback on other items since they have not been exposed to them by the deployed system. As a result, the collected feedback dataset that is used to evaluate a new model is influenced by the deployed system, as a form of closed loop feedback. In this paper, we show that the typical offline evaluation of recommender systems suffers from the so-called Simpson's paradox. Simpson's paradox is the name given to a phenomenon observed when a significant trend appears in several different sub-populations of observational data but disappears or is even reversed when these sub-populations are combined together. Our in-depth experiments based on stratified sampling reveal that a very small minority of items that are frequently exposed by the deployed system plays a confounding factor in the offline evaluation of recommendation systems. In addition, we propose a novel evaluation methodology that takes into account the confounder, i.e the deployed system's characteristics. Using the relative comparison of many recommendation models as in the typical offline evaluation of recommender systems, and based on the Kendall rank correlation coefficient, we show that our proposed evaluation methodology exhibits statistically significant improvements of 14\% and 40\% on the examined open loop datasets (Yahoo! and Coat), respectively, in reflecting the true ranking of systems with an open loop (randomised) evaluation in comparison to the standard evaluation.},

The challenge addresses the growing need for reliable predictions within the boundaries of a shopping session, as customer intentions can be different depending on the occasion. The need for efficient procedures for personalization is even clearer if we consider the e-commerce landscape more broadly: outside of giant digital retailers, the constraints of the problem are stricter, due to smaller user bases and the realization that most users are not frequently returning customers. We release a new session-based dataset including more than 30M fine-grained browsing events (product detail, add, purchase), enriched by linguistic behavior (queries made by shoppers, with items clicked and items not clicked after the query) and catalog meta-data (images, text, pricing information). On this dataset, we ask participants to showcase innovative solutions for two open problems: a recommendation task (where a model is shown some events at the start of a session, and it is asked to predict future product interactions); an intent prediction task, where a model is shown a session containing an add-to-cart event, and it is asked to predict whether the item will be bought before the end of the session.},

The objective is to maximise user clicks over time and to do so we must learn about the quality of each advert in an online manner by observing user clicks. We formulate the problem as a novel variant of a contextual combinatorial multi-armed bandit problem. The context takes the form of a probability distribution over the user's latent topic preference, and rewards are a particular nonlinear function of the selected set and the context. These features ensure that optimal sets of adverts are appropriately diverse. We give a flexible solution method which combines submodular optimisation with existing bandit index policies. User state uncertainty creates ambiguity in interpreting user feedback which prohibits exact Bayesian updating, but we give an approximate method that is shown to work well.},

Developing and training models and algorithms for such recommenders can be especially difficult using static datasets, which often fail to offer the types of counterfactual predictions needed to evaluate policies over extended horizons. To address this, we develop {RecSim} {NG}, a probabilistic platform for the simulation of multi-agent recommender systems. {RecSim} {NG} is a scalable, modular, differentiable simulator implemented in Edward2 and {TensorFlow}. It offers: a powerful, general probabilistic programming language for agent-behavior specification; tools for probabilistic inference and latent-variable model learning, backed by automatic differentiation and tracing; and a {TensorFlow}-based runtime for running simulations on accelerated hardware. We describe {RecSim} {NG} and illustrate how it can be used to create transparent, configurable, end-to-end models of a recommender ecosystem, complemented by a small set of simple use cases that demonstrate how {RecSim} {NG} can help both researchers and practitioners easily develop and train novel algorithms for recommender systems.},

We then examine two of the main user design choices: the proposal distributions and the so called intermediate target distributions. We review recent results on how variational inference and amortization can be used to learn efficient proposals and target distributions. Next, we discuss the {SMC} estimate of the normalizing constant, how this can be used for pseudo-marginal inference and inference evaluation.

A 6 {DOF} sensor measured these critical pitch values during flight, a microcontroller unit activates linear actuators located in the harness of the pilot, and pulls on the D-risers of the paraglider to stabilize the overshooting. This substitutes the active reaction of a pilot and therefore is able to prevent critical flight situations. For evaluation, pitch values with and without stabilization system, during artificially induced overshooting maneuvers, got compared. The evaluation results showed a distinct influence of the system on the pitch behavior of the canopy proving the successful realization of the concept. This project was a feasibility study in terms of electronic stabilization systems for paragliders. It showed such a system is able to increase the safety of paragliders.},

	doi = {10.1145/3383313.3412235},
	abstract = {E-commerce applications rely heavily on session-based recommendation algorithms to improve the shopping experience of their customers. Recent progress in session-based recommendation algorithms shows great promise. However, translating that promise to real-world outcomes is a challenging task for several reasons, but mostly due to the large number and varying characteristics of the available models. In this paper, we discuss the approach and lessons learned from the process of identifying and deploying a successful session-based recommendation algorithm for a leading e-commerce application in the home-improvement domain. To this end, we initially evaluate fourteen session-based recommendation algorithms in an offline setting using eight different popular evaluation metrics on three datasets. The results indicate that offline evaluation does not provide enough insight to make an informed decision since there is no clear winning method on all metrics. Additionally, we observe that standard offline evaluation metrics fall short for this application. Specifically, they reward an algorithm only when it predicts the exact same item that the user clicked next or eventually purchased. In a practical scenario, however, there are near-identical products which, although they are assigned different identifiers, they should be considered as equally-good recommendations. To overcome these limitations, we perform an additional round of evaluation, where human experts provide both objective and subjective feedback for the recommendations of five algorithms that performed the best in the offline evaluation. We find that the experts' opinion is oftentimes different from the offline evaluation results. Analysis of the feedback confirms that the performance of all models is significantly higher when we evaluate near-identical product recommendations as relevant. Finally, we run an A/B test with one of the models that performed the best in the human evaluation phase. The treatment model increased conversion rate by 15.6\% and revenue per visit by 18.5\% when compared with a leading third-party solution.},

	abstract = {Many parameter estimation problems arising in applications can be cast in the framework of Bayesian inversion. This allows not only for an estimate of the parameters, but also for the quantification of uncertainties in the estimates. Often in such problems the parameter-to-data map is very expensive to evaluate, and computing derivatives of the map, or derivative-adjoints, may not be feasible. Additionally, in many applications only noisy evaluations of the map may be available. We propose an approach to Bayesian inversion in such settings that builds on the derivative-free optimization capabilities of ensemble Kalman inversion methods. The overarching approach is to first use ensemble Kalman sampling ({EKS}) to calibrate the unknown parameters to fit the data; second, to use the output of the {EKS} to emulate the parameter-to-data map; third, to sample from an approximate Bayesian posterior distribution in which the parameter-to-data map is replaced by its emulator. This results in a principled approach to approximate Bayesian inference that requires only a small number of evaluations of the (possibly noisy approximation of the) parameter-to-data map. It does not require derivatives of this map, but instead leverages the documented power of ensemble Kalman methods. Furthermore, the {EKS} has the desirable property that it evolves the parameter ensemble towards the regions in which the bulk of the parameter posterior mass is located, thereby locating them well for the emulation phase of the methodology. In essence, the {EKS} methodology provides a cheap solution to the design problem of where to place points in parameter space to efficiently train an emulator of the parameter-to-data map for the purposes of Bayesian inversion.},

However, basic neural networks do not deliver certainty estimates or suffer from over or under confidence. Many researchers have been working on understanding and quantifying uncertainty in a neural network's prediction. As a result, different types and sources of uncertainty have been identified and a variety of approaches to measure and quantify uncertainty in neural networks have been proposed. This work gives a comprehensive overview of uncertainty estimation in neural networks, reviews recent advances in the field, highlights current challenges, and identifies potential research opportunities. It is intended to give anyone interested in uncertainty estimation in neural networks a broad overview and introduction, without presupposing prior knowledge in this field. A comprehensive introduction to the most crucial sources of uncertainty is given and their separation into reducible model uncertainty and not reducible data uncertainty is presented. The modeling of these uncertainties based on deterministic neural networks, Bayesian neural networks, ensemble of neural networks, and test-time data augmentation approaches is introduced and different branches of these fields as well as the latest developments are discussed. For a practical application, we discuss different measures of uncertainty, approaches for the calibration of neural networks and give an overview of existing baselines and implementations. Different examples from the wide spectrum of challenges in different fields give an idea of the needs and challenges regarding uncertainties in practical applications. Additionally, the practical limitations of current methods for mission- and safety-critical real world applications are discussed and an outlook on the next steps towards a broader usage of such methods is given.},

We show that, in the limit, vulnerability to gradient-based attacks arises as a result of degeneracy in the data distribution, i.e., when the data lies on a lower-dimensional submanifold of the ambient space. As a direct consequence, we demonstrate that in the limit {BNN} posteriors are robust to gradient-based adversarial attacks. Experimental results on the {MNIST} and Fashion {MNIST} datasets, representing the finite data regime, with {BNNs} trained with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Variational Inference support this line of argument, showing that {BNNs} can display both high accuracy and robustness to gradient based adversarial attacks.},

	abstract = {We study the problem of off-policy evaluation from batched contextual bandit data with multidimensional actions, often termed slates. The problem is common to recommender systems and user-interface optimization, and it is particularly challenging because of the combinatorially-sized action space. Swaminathan et al. (2017) have proposed the pseudoinverse ({PI}) estimator under the assumption that the conditional mean rewards are additive in actions. Using control variates, we consider a large class of unbiased estimators that includes as specific cases the {PI} estimator and (asymptotically) its self-normalized variant. By optimizing over this class, we obtain new estimators with risk improvement guarantees over both the {PI} and self-normalized {PI} estimators. Experiments with real-world recommender data as well as synthetic data validate these improvements in practice.},

The key idea is to combine the extended Kalman filter (which locally linearizes the likelihood function at each time step) with a (learned or random) low-dimensional affine subspace for the parameters; the use of a subspace enables us to scale our algorithm to models with \${\textbackslash}sim 1M\$ parameters. While most other neural bandit methods need to store the entire past dataset in order to avoid the problem of "catastrophic forgetting", our approach uses constant memory. This is possible because we represent uncertainty about all the parameters in the model, not just the final linear layer. We show good results on the "Deep Bayesian Bandit Showdown" benchmark, as well as {MNIST} and a recommender system.},

For large datasets, the computational cost of {MCMC} can be prohibitive, which has led to recent developments in scalable Monte Carlo algorithms that have a significantly lower computational cost than standard {MCMC}. In this article, we focus on a particular class of scalable Monte Carlo algorithms, stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo ({SGMCMC}) which utilizes data subsampling techniques to reduce the per-iteration cost of {MCMC}. We provide an introduction to some popular {SGMCMC} algorithms and review the supporting theoretical results, as well as comparing the efficiency of {SGMCMC} algorithms against {MCMC} on benchmark examples.

This book is an attempt to structure the complex matter of cross country flying and explain the major elements of this puzzle. It should help beginner cross country pilots to identify their mistakes and accelerate their progress. Advanced pilots might be challenged by some new ideas - or at least understand some techniques that, they’ve already been using subconsciously for years. This book may give comprehensive answers, but at the same time it may open a lot more questions. There is an entire universe of processes, even behind a simple wind gust, even behind a simple gliding flight. There is love and eternity when you merge with the wind and your wing. There is peace and humility when you let Nature be.},

Our approach is to train the machine learning system to regress the rotation frequency of the flow's reference frame, from the observation of the flow's velocity amplitude on a 2d plane extracted from the 3d domain. The machine learning approach consists of a Deep Convolutional Neural Network ({DCNN}) of the same kind developed in computer vision. The training and validation datasets are produced by means of fully resolved direct numerical simulations. This study shows interesting results from two different points of view. From the machine learning point of view it shows the potential of {DCNN}, reaching good results on such a particularly complex problem that goes well outside the limits of human vision. Second, from the physics point of view, it provides an example on how machine learning can be exploited in data analysis to infer information that would be inaccessible otherwise. Indeed, by comparing {DCNN} with the other possible Bayesian approaches, we find that {DCNN} yields to a much higher inference accuracy in all the examined cases.},

In this work, we focus on the fast-developing area of session-based recommendation and aim to contribute to a better understanding of what represents the state-of-the-art. To that purpose, we have conducted an extensive set of experiments, using a variety of datasets, in which we benchmarked four neural approaches that were published in the last three years against each other and against a set of simpler baseline techniques, e.g., based on nearest neighbors. The evaluation of the algorithms under the exact same conditions revealed that the benefts of applying today's neural approaches to session-based recommendations are still limited. In the majority of the cases, and in particular when precision and recall are used, it turned out that simple techniques in most cases outperform recent neural approaches. Our fndings therefore point to certain major limitations of today's research practice. By sharing our evaluation framework publicly, we hope that some of these limitations can be overcome in the future.},

Surprisingly, few data exist on the accuracy of predictions that can be computed in real sensory scenes. Here, we focus on the sensory processing of auditory and audiovisual speech. We propose a set of computational models based on artificial neural networks (mixing deep feedforward and convolutional networks), which are trained to predict future audio observations from present and past audio or audiovisual observations (i.e., including lip movements). Those predictions exploit purely local phonetic regularities with no explicit call to higher linguistic levels. Experiments are conducted on the multispeaker {LibriSpeech} audio speech database (around 100 hours) and on the {NTCD}-{TIMIT} audiovisual speech database (around 7 hours). They appear to be efficient in a short temporal range (25–50 ms), predicting 50\% to 75\% of the variance of the incoming stimulus, which could result in potentially saving up to three-quarters of the processing power. Then they quickly decrease and almost vanish after 250 ms. Adding information on the lips slightly improves predictions, with a 5\% to 10\% increase in explained variance. Interestingly the visual gain vanishes more slowly, and the gain is maximum for a delay of 75 ms between image and predicted sound.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of recommending relevant content to users of an internet platform in the form of lists of items, called slates. We introduce a variational Bayesian Recurrent Neural Net recommender system that acts on time series of interactions between the internet platform and the user, and which scales to real world industrial situations. The recommender system is tested both online on real users, and on an offline dataset collected from a Norwegian web-based marketplace, {FINN}.no, that is made public for research. This is one of the first publicly available datasets which includes all the slates that are presented to users as well as which items (if any) in the slates were clicked on. Such a data set allows us to move beyond the common assumption that implicitly assumes that users are considering all possible items at each interaction. Instead we build our likelihood using the items that are actually in the slate, and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches theoretically and in experiments. We also introduce a hierarchical prior for the item parameters based on group memberships. Both item parameters and user preferences are learned probabilistically. Furthermore, we combine our model with bandit strategies to ensure learning, and introduce `in-slate Thompson Sampling' which makes use of the slates to maximise explorative opportunities. We show experimentally that explorative recommender strategies perform on par or above their greedy counterparts. Even without making use of exploration to learn more effectively, click rates increase simply because of improved diversity in the recommended slates.},

	abstract = {Even though active learning forms an important pillar of machine learning, deep learning tools are not prevalent within it. Deep learning poses several difficulties when used in an active learning setting. First, active learning ({AL}) methods generally rely on being able to learn and update models from small amounts of data. Recent advances in deep learning, on the other hand, are notorious for their dependence on large amounts of data. Second, many {AL} acquisition functions rely on model uncertainty, yet deep learning methods rarely represent such model uncertainty. In this paper we combine recent advances in Bayesian deep learning into the active learning framework in a practical way. We develop an active learning framework for high dimensional data, a task which has been extremely challenging so far, with very sparse existing literature. Taking advantage of specialised models such as Bayesian convolu-tional neural networks, we demonstrate our active learning techniques with image data, obtaining a significant improvement on existing active learning approaches. We demonstrate this on both the {MNIST} dataset, as well as for skin cancer diagnosis from lesion images ({ISIC}2016 task).},

Importantly, our method allows the selection policy learned using simulation on one language to be transferred to other languages. We demonstrate our method using cross-lingual named entity recognition, observing uniform improvements over traditional active learning.},

Active learning mitigates this issue by exploring the unlabeled data space and prioritizing the selection of data that can best improve the model performance. A common approach to active learning is to pick a small sample of data for which the model is most uncertain. In this paper, we explore the efficacy of Bayesian neural networks for active learning, which naturally models uncertainty by learning distribution over the weights of neural networks. By performing a comprehensive set of experiments, we show that Bayesian neural networks are more efficient than ensemble based techniques in capturing uncertainty. Our findings also reveal some key drawbacks of the ensemble techniques, which was recently shown to be more effective than Monte Carlo dropouts.},

	abstract = {Large language models have been shown to achieve remarkable performance across a variety of natural language tasks using few-shot learning, which drastically reduces the number of task-specific training examples needed to adapt the model to a particular application. To further our understanding of the impact of scale on few-shot learning, we trained a 540-billion parameter, densely activated, Transformer language model, which we call Pathways Language Model {PaLM}. We trained {PaLM} on 6144 {TPU} v4 chips using Pathways, a new {ML} system which enables highly efficient training across multiple {TPU} Pods. We demonstrate continued benefits of scaling by achieving state-of-the-art few-shot learning results on hundreds of language understanding and generation benchmarks. On a number of these tasks, {PaLM} 540B achieves breakthrough performance, outperforming the finetuned state-of-the-art on a suite of multi-step reasoning tasks, and outperforming average human performance on the recently released {BIG}-bench benchmark. A significant number of {BIG}-bench tasks showed discontinuous improvements from model scale, meaning that performance steeply increased as we scaled to our largest model. {PaLM} also has strong capabilities in multilingual tasks and source code generation, which we demonstrate on a wide array of benchmarks. We additionally provide a comprehensive analysis on bias and toxicity, and study the extent of training data memorization with respect to model scale. Finally, we discuss the ethical considerations related to large language models and discuss potential mitigation strategies.},

One major hurdle of deep learning approaches is that large sets of labeled data are necessary, which can be prohibitively costly to obtain, particularly in medical image diagnosis applications. Active learning techniques can alleviate this labeling effort. In this paper we investigate some recently proposed methods for active learning with high-dimensional data and convolutional neural network classifiers. We compare ensemble-based methods against Monte-Carlo Dropout and geometric approaches. We find that ensembles perform better and lead to more calibrated predictive uncertainties, which are the basis for many active learning algorithms. To investigate why Monte-Carlo Dropout uncertainties perform worse, we explore potential differences in isolation in a series of experiments. We show results for {MNIST} and {CIFAR}-10, on which we achieve a test set accuracy of 90\% with roughly 12,200 labeled images, and initial results on {ImageNet}. Additionally, we show results on a large, highly class-imbalanced diabetic retinopathy dataset.

	abstract = {Implicit feedback is widely used in collaborative filtering methods for recommendation. It is well known that implicit feedback contains a large number of values that are missing not at random ({MNAR}); and the missing data is a mixture of negative and unknown feedback, making it difficult to learn users' negative preferences. Recent studies modeled exposure, a latent missingness variable which indicates whether an item is exposed to a user, to give each missing entry a confidence of being negative feedback. However, these studies use static models and ignore the information in temporal dependencies among items, which seems to be an essential underlying factor to subsequent missingness. To model and exploit the dynamics of missingness, we propose a latent variable named “user intent” to govern the temporal changes of item missingness, and a hidden Markov model to represent such a process. The resulting framework captures the dynamic item missingness and incorporate it into matrix factorization ({MF}) for recommendation. We also explore two types of constraints to achieve a more compact and interpretable representation of user intents. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method against state-of-the-art recommender systems.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06205},
	abstract = {Candidate generation is the first stage in recommendation systems, where a light-weight system is used to retrieve potentially relevant items for an input user. These candidate items are then ranked and pruned in later stages of recommender systems using a more complex ranking model. Since candidate generation is the top of the recommendation funnel, it is important to retrieve a high-recall candidate set to feed into downstream ranking models. A common approach for candidate generation is to leverage approximate nearest neighbor ({ANN}) search from a single dense query embedding; however, this approach this can yield a low-diversity result set with many near duplicates. As users often have multiple interests, candidate retrieval should ideally return a diverse set of candidates reflective of the user's multiple interests. To this end, we introduce {kNN}-Embed, a general approach to improving diversity in dense {ANN}-based retrieval. {kNN}-Embed represents each user as a smoothed mixture over learned item clusters that represent distinct `interests' of the user. By querying each of a user's mixture component in proportion to their mixture weights, we retrieve a high-diversity set of candidates reflecting elements from each of a user's interests. We experimentally compare {kNN}-Embed to standard {ANN} candidate retrieval, and show significant improvements in overall recall and improved diversity across three datasets. Accompanying this work, we open source a large Twitter follow-graph dataset, to spur further research in graph-mining and representation learning for recommender systems.},

In this survey, we first review the fundamental concepts and notions of fairness that were put forward in the area in the recent past. Afterward, we provide a survey of how research in this area is currently operationalized, for example, in terms of the general research methodology, fairness metrics, and algorithmic approaches. Overall, our analysis of recent works points to certain research gaps.

We achieve the same by extending the lock-in probability (i.e., the probability of convergence of the iterates to a specific attractor of the limiting ordinary differential equation (o.d.e.) given that the iterates are in its domain of attraction after a sufficiently large number of iterations (say) \$n\_0\$) framework to such recursions. Specifically, with the more restrictive assumption of Markov iterate-dependent noise supported on a bounded subset of the Euclidean space, we give a lower bound for the lock-in probability. We use these results to prove almost sure convergence of the iterates to the specified attractor when the iterates satisfy an asymptotic tightness condition. The novelty of our approach is that if the state space of the Markov process is compact, we prove almost sure convergence under much weaker assumptions compared to the work by Andrieu et al., which solves the general state-space case under much restrictive assumptions by providing sufficient conditions for stability of the iterates. We also extend our single-timescale results to the case where there are two separate recursions over two different timescales. This, in turn, is shown to be useful in analyzing the tracking ability of general adaptive algorithms. Additionally, we show that our results can be used to derive a sample complexity estimate of such recursions, which then can be used for step-size selection.},

In order to solve the sparsity problem, some recommender systems use auxiliary information, especially text information, as a supplement to increase the prediction accuracy of the ratings. However, the two mainstream approaches based on text analysis have some limitations. The bag-of-words-based model is one of them, being difficult to use the contextual information of the paragraph effectively so that only the shallow understanding of paragraph can be parsed. Another model based on deep learning can extract the contextual information of the paragraph, but it also increases the complexity of the model. This paper proposes a novel context-aware recommendation model named paragraph vector matrix factorization (P2VMF) which integrates the unsupervised learning of paragraph embeddings into probabilistic matrix factorization ({PMF}). Therefore, P2VMF can capture the semantic information of the paragraph and can improve the prediction accuracy of the ratings. Our extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that the performance of the P2VMF model is preferable as compared with those multiple recommendation models in the situation, where the ratings are quite sparse. And we also verified that the P2V part of the model can well express the semantics in the form of vectors.},

However, despite this algorithmic progress and the promise of improved uncertainty quantification and sample efficiency there are---as of early 2020---no publicized deployments of Bayesian neural networks in industrial practice. In this work we cast doubt on the current understanding of Bayes posteriors in popular deep neural networks: we demonstrate through careful {MCMC} sampling that the posterior predictive induced by the Bayes posterior yields systematically worse predictions compared to simpler methods including point estimates obtained from {SGD}. Furthermore, we demonstrate that predictive performance is improved significantly through the use of a "cold posterior" that overcounts evidence. Such cold posteriors sharply deviate from the Bayesian paradigm but are commonly used as heuristic in Bayesian deep learning papers. We put forward several hypotheses that could explain cold posteriors and evaluate the hypotheses through experiments. Our work questions the goal of accurate posterior approximations in Bayesian deep learning: If the true Bayes posterior is poor, what is the use of more accurate approximations? Instead, we argue that it is timely to focus on understanding the origin of the improved performance of cold posteriors.},

Taking inspiration from temporal-difference learning, a central idea in reinforcement learning, we develop algorithms that estimate a discrete-time survival model by exploiting a temporal-consistency condition. Intuitively, this condition captures the fact that the survival distribution at consecutive states should be similar, accounting for the delay between states. Our method can be combined with any parametric survival model and naturally accommodates right-censored observations. We demonstrate empirically that it achieves better sample-efficiency and predictive performance compared to approaches that directly regress the observed survival outcome.},

	abstract = {Recommender systems ({RSs}) have become an inseparable part of our everyday lives. They help us find our favorite items to purchase, our friends on social networks, and our favorite movies to watch. Traditionally, the recommendation problem was considered to be a classification or prediction problem, but it is now widely agreed that formulating it as a sequential decision problem can better reflect the user-system interaction. Therefore, it can be formulated as a Markov decision process ({MDP}) and be solved by reinforcement learning ({RL}) algorithms. Unlike traditional recommendation methods, including collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, {RL} is able to handle the sequential, dynamic user-system interaction and to take into account the long-term user engagement. Although the idea of using {RL} for recommendation is not new and has been around for about two decades, it was not very practical, mainly because of scalability problems of traditional {RL} algorithms. However, a new trend has emerged in the field since the introduction of deep reinforcement learning ({DRL}), which made it possible to apply {RL} to the recommendation problem with large state and action spaces. In this paper, a survey on reinforcement learning based recommender systems ({RLRSs}) is presented. Our aim is to present an outlook on the field and to provide the reader with a fairly complete knowledge of key concepts of the field. We first recognize and illustrate that {RLRSs} can be generally classified into {RL}- and {DRL}-based methods. Then, we propose an {RLRS} framework with four components, i.e., state representation, policy optimization, reward formulation, and environment building, and survey {RLRS} algorithms accordingly. We highlight emerging topics and depict important trends using various graphs and tables. Finally, we discuss important aspects and challenges that can be addressed in the future.},

However, selecting the most relevant items (albums, artists, playlists...) to display in these carousels is a challenging task, as items are numerous and as users have different preferences. In this paper, we model carousel personalization as a contextual multi-armed bandit problem with multiple plays, cascade-based updates and delayed batch feedback. We empirically show the effectiveness of our framework at capturing characteristics of real-world carousels by addressing a large-scale playlist recommendation task on a global music streaming mobile app. Along with this paper, we publicly release industrial data from our experiments, as well as an open-source environment to simulate comparable carousel personalization learning problems.},

	abstract = {Recommender systems play a crucial role in our daily lives. Feed streaming mechanism has been widely used in the recommender system, especially on the mobile Apps. The feed streaming setting provides users the interactive manner of recommendation in never-ending feeds. In such an interactive manner, a good recommender system should pay more attention to user stickiness, which is far beyond classical instant metrics, and typically measured by \{{\textbackslash}bf long-term user engagement\}. Directly optimizing the long-term user engagement is a non-trivial problem, as the learning target is usually not available for conventional supervised learning methods. Though reinforcement learning{\textasciitilde}({RL}) naturally fits the problem of maximizing the long term rewards, applying {RL} to optimize long-term user engagement is still facing challenges: user behaviors are versatile and difficult to model, which typically consists of both instant feedback{\textasciitilde}(e.g. clicks, ordering) and delayed feedback{\textasciitilde}(e.g. dwell time, revisit); in addition, performing effective off-policy learning is still immature, especially when combining bootstrapping and function approximation. To address these issues, in this work, we introduce a reinforcement learning framework --- {FeedRec} to optimize the long-term user engagement. {FeedRec} includes two components: 1){\textasciitilde}a Q-Network which designed in hierarchical {LSTM} takes charge of modeling complex user behaviors, and 2){\textasciitilde}an S-Network, which simulates the environment, assists the Q-Network and voids the instability of convergence in policy learning. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and a real-world large scale data show that {FeedRec} effectively optimizes the long-term user engagement and outperforms state-of-the-arts.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2005.14165},
	abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many {NLP} tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current {NLP} systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train {GPT}-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, {GPT}-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. {GPT}-3 achieves strong performance on many {NLP} datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where {GPT}-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where {GPT}-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that {GPT}-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of {GPT}-3 in general.},

	abstract = {Natural language processing tasks, such as question answering, machine translation, reading comprehension, and summarization, are typically approached with supervised learning on taskspeciﬁc datasets. We demonstrate that language models begin to learn these tasks without any explicit supervision when trained on a new dataset of millions of webpages called {WebText}. When conditioned on a document plus questions, the answers generated by the language model reach 55 F1 on the {CoQA} dataset - matching or exceeding the performance of 3 out of 4 baseline systems without using the 127,000+ training examples. The capacity of the language model is essential to the success of zero-shot task transfer and increasing it improves performance in a log-linear fashion across tasks. Our largest model, {GPT}-2, is a 1.5B parameter Transformer that achieves state of the art results on 7 out of 8 tested language modeling datasets in a zero-shot setting but still underﬁts {WebText}. Samples from the model reﬂect these improvements and contain coherent paragraphs of text. These ﬁndings suggest a promising path towards building language processing systems which learn to perform tasks from their naturally occurring demonstrations.},

The counter-intuitive empirical observation is that even though the use of likelihood as training objective leads to high quality models for a broad range of language understanding tasks, using likelihood as a decoding objective leads to text that is bland and strangely repetitive. In this paper, we reveal surprising distributional differences between human text and machine text. In addition, we find that decoding strategies alone can dramatically effect the quality of machine text, even when generated from exactly the same neural language model. Our findings motivate Nucleus Sampling, a simple but effective method to draw the best out of neural generation. By sampling text from the dynamic nucleus of the probability distribution, which allows for diversity while effectively truncating the less reliable tail of the distribution, the resulting text better demonstrates the quality of human text, yielding enhanced diversity without sacrificing fluency and coherence.},

Recently, Transformers and its variants have achieved remarkable effectiveness without explicit latent representation learning, thus lack satisfying controllability in generation. In this paper, we advocate to revive latent variable modeling, essentially the power of representation learning, in the era of Transformers to enhance controllability without hurting state-of-the-art generation effectiveness. Specifically, we integrate latent representation vectors with a Transformer-based pre-trained architecture to build conditional variational autoencoder ({CVAE}).

In particular, standard likelihood training and decoding leads to dull and repetitive outputs. While some post-hoc fixes have been proposed, in particular top-\$k\$ and nucleus sampling, they do not address the fact that the token-level probabilities predicted by the model are poor. In this paper we show that the likelihood objective itself is at fault, resulting in a model that assigns too much probability to sequences containing repeats and frequent words, unlike those from the human training distribution. We propose a new objective, unlikelihood training, which forces unlikely generations to be assigned lower probability by the model. We show that both token and sequence level unlikelihood training give less repetitive, less dull text while maintaining perplexity, giving superior generations using standard greedy or beam search. According to human evaluations, our approach with standard beam search also outperforms the currently popular decoding methods of nucleus sampling or beam blocking, thus providing a strong alternative to existing techniques.},

	abstract = {This survey reviews works in which language models ({LMs}) are augmented with reasoning skills and the ability to use tools. The former is defined as decomposing a potentially complex task into simpler subtasks while the latter consists in calling external modules such as a code interpreter. {LMs} can leverage these augmentations separately or in combination via heuristics, or learn to do so from demonstrations. While adhering to a standard missing tokens prediction objective, such augmented {LMs} can use various, possibly non-parametric external modules to expand their context processing ability, thus departing from the pure language modeling paradigm. We therefore refer to them as Augmented Language Models ({ALMs}). The missing token objective allows {ALMs} to learn to reason, use tools, and even act, while still performing standard natural language tasks and even outperforming most regular {LMs} on several benchmarks. In this work, after reviewing current advance in {ALMs}, we conclude that this new research direction has the potential to address common limitations of traditional {LMs} such as interpretability, consistency, and scalability issues.},

At the same time, studies using real user traces suggest that recommender systems are not the primary driver of attention toward extreme content; on the contrary, such content is mostly reached through other means, e.g., other websites. In this paper, we explain the following apparent paradox: if the recommendation algorithm favors extreme content, why is it not driving its consumption? With a simple agent-based model where users attribute different utilities to items in the recommender system, we show that the collaborative-filtering nature of recommender systems and the nicheness of extreme content can resolve the apparent paradox: although blindly following recommendations would indeed lead users to niche content, users rarely consume niche content when given the option because it is of low utility to them, which can lead the recommender system to deamplify such content. Our results call for a nuanced interpretation of ``algorithmic amplification'' and highlight the importance of modeling the utility of content to users when auditing recommender systems.},

Existing studies that incorporate Transformers into text {VAEs} (Li et al., 2020; Fang et al., 2021) mitigate posterior collapse using massive pretraining, a technique unavailable to most of the research community without extensive computing resources. We present a simple two-phase training scheme to convert a sequence-to-sequence Transformer into a {VAE} with just finetuning. The resulting language model is competitive with massively pretrained Transformer-based {VAEs} in some internal metrics while falling short on others.

	abstract = {An important paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale pre-training on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or domains. As we pre-train larger models, full fine-tuning, which retrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using {GPT}-3 175B as an example -- deploying independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or {LoRA}, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to {GPT}-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, {LoRA} can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the {GPU} memory requirement by 3 times. {LoRA} performs on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on {RoBERTa}, {DeBERTa}, {GPT}-2, and {GPT}-3, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters, no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efficacy of {LoRA}. We release a package that facilitates the integration of {LoRA} with {PyTorch} models and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for {RoBERTa}, {DeBERTa}, and {GPT}-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/{LoRA}.},

	abstract = {In this work, we explore “prompt tuning,” a simple yet effective mechanism for learning “soft prompts” to condition frozen language models to perform specific downstream tasks. Unlike the discrete text prompts used by {GPT}-3, soft prompts are learned through backpropagation and can be tuned to incorporate signals from any number of labeled examples. Our end-to-end learned approach outperforms {GPT}-3's few-shot learning by a large margin. More remarkably, through ablations on model size using T5, we show that prompt tuning becomes more competitive with scale: as models exceed billions of parameters, our method “closes the gap” and matches the strong performance of model tuning (where all model weights are tuned). This finding is especially relevant because large models are costly to share and serve and the ability to reuse one frozen model for multiple downstream tasks can ease this burden. Our method can be seen as a simplification of the recently proposed “prefix tuning” of Li and Liang (2021) and we provide a comparison to this and other similar approaches. Finally, we show that conditioning a frozen model with soft prompts confers benefits in robustness to domain transfer and enables efficient “prompt ensembling.” We release code and model checkpoints to reproduce our experiments.},

While conceptually simple, this combination has a number of empirical shortcomings, suggesting that learned models may not be well-suited to standard trajectory optimization. In this paper, we consider what it would look like to fold as much of the trajectory optimization pipeline as possible into the modeling problem, such that sampling from the model and planning with it become nearly identical. The core of our technical approach lies in a diffusion probabilistic model that plans by iteratively denoising trajectories. We show how classifier-guided sampling and image inpainting can be reinterpreted as coherent planning strategies, explore the unusual and useful properties of diffusion-based planning methods, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in control settings that emphasize long-horizon decision-making and test-time flexibility.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2305.15717},
	abstract = {An emerging method to cheaply improve a weaker language model is to finetune it on outputs from a stronger model, such as a proprietary system like {ChatGPT} (e.g., Alpaca, Self-Instruct, and others). This approach looks to cheaply imitate the proprietary model's capabilities using a weaker open-source model. In this work, we critically analyze this approach. We first finetune a series of {LMs} that imitate {ChatGPT} using varying base model sizes (1.5B--13B), data sources, and imitation data amounts (0.3M--150M tokens). We then evaluate the models using crowd raters and canonical {NLP} benchmarks. Initially, we were surprised by the output quality of our imitation models -- they appear far better at following instructions, and crowd workers rate their outputs as competitive with {ChatGPT}. However, when conducting more targeted automatic evaluations, we find that imitation models close little to none of the gap from the base {LM} to {ChatGPT} on tasks that are not heavily supported in the imitation data. We show that these performance discrepancies may slip past human raters because imitation models are adept at mimicking {ChatGPT}'s style but not its factuality. Overall, we conclude that model imitation is a false promise: there exists a substantial capabilities gap between open and closed {LMs} that, with current methods, can only be bridged using an unwieldy amount of imitation data or by using more capable base {LMs}. In turn, we argue that the highest leverage action for improving open-source models is to tackle the difficult challenge of developing better base {LMs}, rather than taking the shortcut of imitating proprietary systems.},

	abstract = {Large language models ({LLMs}) have formulated a blueprint for the advancement of artificial general intelligence. Its primary objective is to function as a humancentric (helpful, honest, and harmless) assistant. Alignment with humans assumes paramount significance, and reinforcement learning with human feedback ({RLHF}) emerges as the pivotal technological paradigm underpinning this pursuit. Current technical routes usually include reward models to measure human preferences, Proximal Policy Optimization ({PPO}) to optimize policy model outputs, and process supervision to improve step-by-step reasoning capabilities. However, due to the challenges of reward design, environment interaction, and agent training, coupled with huge trial and error cost of large language models, there is a significant barrier for {AI} researchers to motivate the development of technical alignment and safe landing of {LLMs}. The stable training of {RLHF} has still been a puzzle.},

	abstract = {In many sequential decision-making problems (e.g., robotics control, game playing, sequential prediction), human or expert data is available containing useful information about the task. However, imitation learning ({IL}) from a small amount of expert data can be challenging in high-dimensional environments with complex dynamics. Behavioral cloning is a simple method that is widely used due to its simplicity of implementation and stable convergence but doesn't utilize any information involving the environment's dynamics. Many existing methods that exploit dynamics information are difficult to train in practice due to an adversarial optimization process over reward and policy approximators or biased, high variance gradient estimators. We introduce a method for dynamics-aware {IL} which avoids adversarial training by learning a single Q-function, implicitly representing both reward and policy. On standard benchmarks, the implicitly learned rewards show a high positive correlation with the ground-truth rewards, illustrating our method can also be used for inverse reinforcement learning ({IRL}). Our method, Inverse soft-Q learning ({IQ}-Learn) obtains state-of-the-art results in offline and online imitation learning settings, significantly outperforming existing methods both in the number of required environment interactions and scalability in high-dimensional spaces, often by more than 3x.},

Inverse reinforcement learning ({IRL}) is a specific form of learning from demonstration that attempts to estimate the reward function of a Markov decision process from examples provided by the teacher. The reward function is often considered the most succinct description of a task. In simple applications, the reward function may be known or easily derived from properties of the system and hard coded into the learning process. However, in complex applications, this may not be possible, and it may be easier to learn the reward function by observing the actions of the teacher. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the literature on {IRL}. This survey outlines the differences between {IRL} and two similar methods - apprenticeship learning and inverse optimal control. Further, this survey organizes the {IRL} literature based on the principal method, describes applications of {IRL} algorithms, and provides areas of future research.},

We propose a sample efficient model-based visual {RL} algorithm built on {MuZero}, which we name {EfficientZero}. Our method achieves 194.3\% mean human performance and 109.0\% median performance on the Atari 100k benchmark with only two hours of real-time game experience and outperforms the state {SAC} in some tasks on the {DMControl} 100k benchmark. This is the first time an algorithm achieves super-human performance on Atari games with such little data. {EfficientZero}'s performance is also close to {DQN}'s performance at 200 million frames while we consume 500 times less data. {EfficientZero}'s low sample complexity and high performance can bring {RL} closer to real-world applicability. We implement our algorithm in an easy-to-understand manner and it is available at https://github.com/{YeWR}/{EfficientZero}.

In this work we present the {MuZero} algorithm which, by combining a tree-based search with a learned model, achieves superhuman performance in a range of challenging and visually complex domains, without any knowledge of their underlying dynamics. {MuZero} learns a model that, when applied iteratively, predicts the quantities most directly relevant to planning: the reward, the action-selection policy, and the value function. When evaluated on 57 different Atari games - the canonical video game environment for testing {AI} techniques, in which model-based planning approaches have historically struggled - our new algorithm achieved a new state of the art.

	abstract = {Large language models ({LLMs}) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities, especially when prompted to generate intermediate reasoning steps (e.g., Chain-of-Thought, {CoT}). However, {LLMs} can still struggle with problems that are easy for humans, such as generating action plans for executing tasks in a given environment, or performing complex math, logical, and commonsense reasoning. The deficiency stems from the key fact that {LLMs} lack an internal \${\textbackslash}textit\{world model\}\$ to predict the world \${\textbackslash}textit\{state\}\$ (e.g., environment status, intermediate variable values) and simulate long-term outcomes of actions. This prevents {LLMs} from performing deliberate planning akin to human brains, which involves exploring alternative reasoning paths, anticipating future states and rewards, and iteratively refining existing reasoning steps. To overcome the limitations, we propose a new {LLM} reasoning framework, \${\textbackslash}underline\{R\}\$easoning vi\${\textbackslash}underline\{a\}\$ \${\textbackslash}underline\{P\}\$lanning \${\textbackslash}textbf\{({RAP})\}\$. {RAP} repurposes the {LLM} as both a world model and a reasoning agent, and incorporates a principled planning algorithm (based on Monto Carlo Tree Search) for strategic exploration in the vast reasoning space. During reasoning, the {LLM} (as agent) incrementally builds a reasoning tree under the guidance of the {LLM} (as world model) and task-specific rewards, and obtains a high-reward reasoning path efficiently with a proper balance between exploration \${\textbackslash}textit\{vs.\}\$ exploitation. We apply {RAP} to a variety of challenging reasoning problems including plan generation, math reasoning, and logical inference. Empirical results on these tasks demonstrate the superiority of {RAP} over various strong baselines, including {CoT} and least-to-most prompting with self-consistency. {RAP} on {LLAMA}-33B surpasses {CoT} on {GPT}-4 with 33\% relative improvement in a plan generation setting.},

	abstract = {The Mixture-of-Experts ({MoE}) layer, a sparsely-activated model controlled by a router, has achieved great success in deep learning. However, the understanding of such architecture remains elusive. In this paper, we formally study how the {MoE} layer improves the performance of neural network learning and why the mixture model will not collapse into a single model. Our empirical results suggest that the cluster structure of the underlying problem and the non-linearity of the expert are pivotal to the success of {MoE}. To further understand this, we consider a challenging classiﬁcation problem with intrinsic cluster structures, which is hard to learn using a single expert. Yet with the {MoE} layer, by choosing the experts as two-layer nonlinear convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}), we show that the problem can be learned successfully. Furthermore, our theory shows that the router can learn the cluster-center features, which helps divide the input complex problem into simpler linear classiﬁcation sub-problems that individual experts can conquer. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst result towards formally understanding the mechanism of the {MoE} layer for deep learning.},

Most previous works considers adding the dense trainable parameters, where all parameters are used to adapt certain task. We found this less effective empirically using the example of {LoRA} that introducing more trainable parameters does not help. Motivated by this we investigate the importance of leveraging “sparse” computation and propose {SiRA}: sparse mixture of low rank adaption. {SiRA} leverages the Sparse Mixture of Expert({SMoE}) to boost the performance of {LoRA}. Specifically it enforces the top k experts routing with a capacity limit restricting the maximum number of tokens each expert can process. We propose a novel and simple expert dropout on top of gating network to reduce the over-fitting issue. Through extensive experiments, we verify {SiRA} performs better than {LoRA} and other mixture of expert approaches across different single tasks and multitask settings.},

	abstract = {Sparse Mixture-of-Experts ({MoE}) is a neural architecture design that can be utilized to add learnable parameters to Large Language Models ({LLMs}) without increasing inference cost. Instruction tuning is a technique for training {LLMs} to follow instructions. We advocate combining these two approaches, as we find that {MoE} models benefit more from instruction tuning than dense models. In particular, we conduct empirical studies across three experimental setups: (i) Direct finetuning on individual downstream tasks devoid of instruction tuning; (ii) Instructiontuning followed by in-context few-shot or zero-shot generalization on downstream tasks; and (iii) Instruction tuning supplemented by further finetuning on individual downstream tasks. In the first scenario, {MoE} models overall underperform dense models of identical computational capacity. This narrative, however, dramatically changes with the introduction of instruction tuning (second and third scenario), used independently or in conjunction with task-specific finetuning. Our most powerful model, {FLAN}-{MOE}-32B, surpasses the performance of {FLAN}-{PALM}-62B on four benchmark tasks, while using only a third of the {FLOPs}. The advancements embodied {byFLAN}-{MOE} inspire a reevaluation of the design principles of large-scale, high-performance language models in the framework of task-agnostic learning.},

	shorttitle = {Direct Preference Optimization},
	abstract = {While large-scale unsupervised language models ({LMs}) learn broad world knowledge and some reasoning skills, achieving precise control of their behavior is difficult due to the completely unsupervised nature of their training. Existing methods for gaining such steerability collect human labels of the relative quality of model generations and fine-tune the unsupervised {LM} to align with these preferences, often with reinforcement learning from human feedback ({RLHF}). However, {RLHF} is a complex and often unstable procedure, first fitting a reward model that reflects the human preferences, and then fine-tuning the large unsupervised {LM} using reinforcement learning to maximize this estimated reward without drifting too far from the original model. In this paper we introduce a new parameterization of the reward model in {RLHF} that enables extraction of the corresponding optimal policy in closed form, allowing us to solve the standard {RLHF} problem with only a simple classification loss. The resulting algorithm, which we call Direct Preference Optimization ({DPO}), is stable, performant, and computationally lightweight, eliminating the need for sampling from the {LM} during fine-tuning or performing significant hyperparameter tuning. Our experiments show that {DPO} can fine-tune {LMs} to align with human preferences as well as or better than existing methods. Notably, fine-tuning with {DPO} exceeds {PPO}-based {RLHF} in ability to control sentiment of generations, and matches or improves response quality in summarization and single-turn dialogue while being substantially simpler to implement and train.},

	abstract = {From Kahneman \& Tversky’s seminal work on prospect theory (1992), we know that humans perceive random variables in a systematically distorted manner; for example, they are more sensitive to losses than gains of the same magnitude. We show that existing methods for aligning {LLMs} with human feedback implicitly model some of these distortions, making them human-centered loss functions ({HALOs}). However, the utility functions these methods impute to humans still differ in some ways from those in the prospect theory literature. By bridging this gap, we derive a {HALO} that directly maximizes the utility of {LLM} generations instead of maximizing the log-likelihood of preferences, as current methods do. We call our approach Kahneman-Tversky Optimization ({KTO}). {KTO} matches or exceeds the performance of direct preference optimization methods at scales from 1B to 30B. Moreover, because {KTO} does not need preference pairs—only knowledge of whether an output is desirable or undesirable for a given input—it is much easier to deploy in the real world, where the latter kind of data is far more abundant.},

Due to their structural similarity to written language, transformer-based architectures [2] have also shown promise as tools to make sense of a range of multi-variate sequences from protein-structures [3, 4], music [5, 6], electronic health records [7] to weather-forecasts [8, 9]. We can also represent human lives in a way that shares this structural similarity to language [10]. From one perspective, lives are simply sequences of events: People are born, visit the pediatrician, start school, move to a new location, get married, and so on. Here, we exploit this similarity to adapt innovations from natural language processing to examine the evolution and predictability of human lives based on detailed event sequences. We do this by drawing on arguably the most comprehensive registry data in existence, available for an entire nation of more than six million individuals across decades [11, 12, 13, 14]. Our data include information about life-events related to health, education, occupation, income, address, and working hours, recorded with day-to-day resolution. We create embeddings of life-events in a single vector space showing that this embedding space is robust and highly structured. Our models allow us to predict diverse outcomes ranging from early mortality to personality nuances, outperforming state-of-the-art models by a wide margin. Using methods for interpreting deep learning models, we probe the algorithm to understand the factors that enable our predictions. Our framework allows researchers to identify new potential mechanisms that impact life outcomes and associated possibilities for personalized interventions.},

This paper proposes a multi-task approach to explicitly incorporate information about negation in sentiment analysis, which we show outperforms learning negation implicitly in a data-driven manner. We describe our approach, a cascading neural architecture with selective sharing of {LSTM} layers, and show that explicitly training the model with negation as an auxiliary task helps improve the main task of sentiment analysis. The effect is demonstrated across several different standard English-language data sets for both tasks and we analyze several aspects of our system related to its performance, varying types and amounts of input data and different multi-task setups.},

We introduce Toolformer, a model trained to decide which {APIs} to call, when to call them, what arguments to pass, and how to best incorporate the results into future token prediction. This is done in a self-supervised way, requiring nothing more than a handful of demonstrations for each {API}. We incorporate a range of tools, including a calculator, a Q\&A system, a search engine, a translation system, and a calendar.

Using scaling arguments for large width networks, we demonstrate that using the same learning rate for A and B does not allow efficient feature learning.

	abstract = {Multitask Learning is an approach to inductive transfer that improves generalization by using the domain information contained in the training signals of related tasks as an inductive bias. It does this by learning tasks in parallel while using a shared representation; what is learned for each task can help other tasks be learned better. This paper reviews prior work on {MTL}, presents new evidence that {MTL} in backprop nets discovers task relatedness without the need of supervisory signals, and presents new results for {MTL} with k-nearest neighbor and kernel regression. In this paper we demonstrate multitask learning in three domains. We explain how multitask learning works, and show that there are many opportunities for multitask learning in real domains. We present an algorithm and results for multitask learning with case-based methods like k-nearest neighbor and kernel regression, and sketch an algorithm for multitask learning in decision trees. Because multitask learning works, can be applied to many different kinds of domains, and can be used with different learning algorithms, we conjecture there will be many opportunities for its use on real-world problems.},
